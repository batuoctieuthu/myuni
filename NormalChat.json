	"naturally reduce anxiety":[
		"1. Regular exercise. When it comes to what type of exercise, this is more of a personal preference. If you're looking to really get your heart rate up, something like a HIIT class (high-intensity interval training) or running is your best bet.\n2. Drink chamomile tea to calm frayed nerves and promote sleep.\n3. Try aromatherapy, the practice uses natural plant extracts and essential oils to promote the health and well-being of the mind, body, and spirit. Some essential oils believed to relieve anxiety are: bergamot, lavender, clary sage, grapefruit, ylang ylang.\n4. Eat a balanced diet, a high-sugar diet may also impact temperament. If your anxiety worsens after eating, check your eating habits. Stay hydrated, eliminate processed foods, and eat a balanced diet rich in complex carbohydrates, fruits and vegetables, and lean proteins.\n5. Prioritize getting a good night’s rest, You can make sleep a priority by: only sleeping at night when you're tired, not reading or watching television in bed, not using your phone, tablet, or computer in bed, not tossing and turning in your bed or going to another room if you can't sleep, avoiding caffeine, large meals, and nicotine before bedtime, keeping your room dark and cool, writing down your worries before going to bed, going to sleep at the same time each night.\n6. Limit caffeine intake. If you have chronic anxiety, caffeine is not your friend. Caffeine may cause nervousness and jitters, neither of which is good if you're anxious. Research has shown caffeine may cause or worsen anxiety disorders. It may also cause panic attacks in people with panic disorder. In some people, eliminating caffeine may significantly improve anxiety symptoms.\n7. Steer clear of alcohol, drinking alcohol may take the edge off at first, since it's a natural sedative. However, research Trusted source suggests there's a link between anxiety and alcohol consumption, with anxiety disorders and alcohol use disorder (AUD) occurring hand-in-hand.\n8. Consider quitting smoking cigarettes, smokers often reach for a cigarette during stressful times. Yet, like drinking alcohol, taking a drag on a cigarette when you're stressed is a quick fix that may worsen anxiety over time. ResearchTrusted Source has shown that the earlier you start smoking in life, the higher your risk of developing an anxiety disorder later."

	"how to set healthy social media boundaries":[
		"If social media is a part of your life, that's OK. There are ways to lessen the negative effects and enhance the positive effects of social media, even while you're using it: Unfollow accounts that have a negative effect on your mood or self-image, Remove photos from your own profile that trigger self-judgment, Delete any negative DMs, trolling, or spam, Unsave posts that encourage you to compare yourself to others, Skip the filter and showcase the real you, Post photos of the “messy” moments, not just the perfect ones, Remind others in your captions that you're a real person with flaws, hang-ups, and insecurities — just like them, Post encouraging comments on others' posts."

	"things to do instead of social media":[
		"If you use social media to relax, consider swapping for these options instead: Take a walk around the block, Put on some music, Set the mood with candles or diffuse some essential oils, Read a book, Try doodling or crafting, Bake something delicious, Play with a pet, Try yoga or meditation, Drink a soothing, hot beverage, like a tea or hot chocolate.\nIf you use social media to connect with others, try these activities instead: Call a friend or family member (bonus points for a video call!), Invite someone over for dinner or drinks, Bake something and offer it to your neighbors, lingering to chat when you deliver it, Organize a weekend brunch, hike, or shopping trip with friends, Check out Meetup.com for like-minded groups to join (and actually attend an event!), Volunteer at a local food bank or other organization, Take a class through your local Parks and Recreation Department, Join a community group, like a church, nonprofit, or club, Take a goat yoga class — you're almost certain to come away smiling.\nInstead of memes and 30-second videos, opt for some IRL entertainment: Go see some live music, Try a paint your own pottery studio, like Color Me Mine, Learn an instrument, Take a dance or martial arts class, Take a hike (literally), Take a trip to a local museum, Try your hand at gardening, Listen to a podcast, Read a book, Gather some friends or family and play a board game."

	"ways to give my mind a deep cleaning":[
		"Hi! Ways to give your mind a deep cleaning are:\n1. Make a long talk with someone you trust, discussing your problems can help you lay them out more logically, since you have to explain what's troubling you in a way that others understand. Talking to family and friends can help you to start working through frustrations and clearing out your mind. If you can't seem to break out of the mental fog on your own, though, a professional can offer a little extra support.\n2. Letting yourself unfocus by briefly zoning out activates the default mode network in your brain, giving it a chance to take a rest. Just as sleep benefits you, this rest period benefits your brain. Unfocusing can help promote creativity, sharpen thought processes, and improve memory and learning. A few key ways to unfocus: take a nap, go for a walk, daydream (just make sure it's the helpful type of daydreamingTrusted Source), doodle.\n3. Putting your work area back into order can help you refresh your thinking process, but it could also take up a lot of time — not good when you're on a tight deadline. Instead, try making a regular effort to maintain the tidiness of your workspace to boost cognitive function and improve workflow.\n4. Get musical, if you listen to music regularly, you may have already noticed it makes it easier to keep your attention on your work and complete it successfully.\n5. Changing your environment and getting outside for a walk offers a great opportunity to clear your head and refocus. Exercising for 20 or 30 minutes can help improve decision-making and reaction time just before a cognitive task, but walking also offers long-term benefits, too.\n6. A good night's sleep can refresh you when you feel physically tired. What you might not know, though, is that getting enough sleep can also help safeguard against mental fatigue and emotional distress."

	"how to boost my immune system":[
		"According to experts, to boost your immune system, you should:\n1. Eat foods rich in antioxidants. Citrus fruits, red bell peppers, almonds, sunflower seeds, walnuts, beans, and garlic all have research behind them to back up their immune-boosting claims.\n2. Work up a sweat regularly. A 2019 scientific review in the Journal of Sports and Health Science found that moderate to vigorous exercise can power your immune response, lower your risk of illness, and reduce inflammation.\n3. According to the National Sleep Foundation, adults between 18 and 64 need 7-9 hours of sleep per night, while older adults need 7-8 hours, and children and adolescents require even more sleep. Aim for the amount that's right for your age group, and try to be as consistent as possible. Also, don't assume you can just catch up on sleep after a night or two of staying up late or tossing and turning.\n4. Unchecked stress, anxiety, worry, and panic pack a lot of negative health effects, and suppressing the immune system is one of them. You can still take some small steps to help chill and unwind. Meditation is one strategy; you can also try a mental health app, a stress-busting workout, a catch-up call with a friend. Excessive social media usage might actually increase your stress and anxiety, but screen time watching a movie you love or a binge session of your favorite escapist show will help take your mind off things.\n5. Limit alcohol intake, moderate alcohol consumption doesn't appear to have any positive effects on your immune system, and binge-drinking (more than four drinks in two hours for women and five for men) has been shown to impair immunity in previous research. Alcohol temporarily increases the number of white blood cells, which are the infection fighters, in your bloodstream.\n6. Dr. LeComte says the trace mineral zinc is needed by the body to make all of the different cells of the immune system, and for those cells to function properly. While you can typically get the daily recommended amount—11 mg for men, 8 mg for women—through whole foods like oysters, red meat, seafood, beans, nuts, and whole grains but considering a supplement after talking to your doctor and getting your blood levels checked to see if you aren't getting enough from food alone."

	"the best trees to reduce air pollution":[
		"Plants are often seen as the “lungs” of an ecosystem because they absorb carbon dioxide and emit oxygen. But they also act as an ecosystems “liver” too, filtering atmospheric pollutants like sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide through their leaves. Trees are particularly effective at removing particulate matter (PM). PM comes in the form of tiny particles of organic chemicals, acids, metals and dust, emitted from fossil-fuel-burning vehicles and factories, as well as construction sites. Then there are PM2 and even smaller nanoparticle pollution.\nFine particulate matter can easily penetrate into human respiratory system, causing lung and cardiovascular diseases or exacerbating respiratory illness. It has also been linked to inflammation and heart disease. Silver birch, yew and elder trees were the most effective at capturing particles, and it was the hairs of their leaves that contributed to reduction rates of 79%, 71% and 70% respectively. In contrast, nettles emerged as the least useful of the species studied, though they still captured a respectable 32%."

	"what are best types of roses to grow":[
		"One of the best ways to zero in on the type of roses you want to grow is to consider the classifications of Modern, Old Garden, and Wild Roses that rose experts use. Modern Roses (1867 – today): Most rose varieties you come across will probably be modern. What sets these types of roses apart from earlier roses is how they were created: through a precise breeding process using a wider range of exotic rose parents: Hybrid Tea Roses, Grandiflora, Polyantha, Floribunda, English and Classic-Style Roses.\nOld Garden Roses (pre 1867): You may prefer to call these antique, heirloom, heritage, or vintage roses. Most of them don't exist anymore, but those that are still around survive because they lavishly reward gardeners with some of the most sophisticated floral forms and scents that roses have to offer: Historic European and Middle Eastern Roses, Roses of Ancient China, Almost-Modern Old Roses.\nWild Roses: If you want to grow a rose in sand or swampy soil, or simply want to create a naturalistic planting or meadow, you can't beat wild roses. Only a handful of them repeat flower through the season like Modern Roses, so if you want all-season bloom, look for Rosa rugosa and its hybrids or the Repeating Swamp Rose. If you want to go native, go for the Repeating Swamp Rose, growing conditions is full sun to part shade in almost any soil."

	"i want helping kids dealing with being left out":[
		"Well, Psychologists have noted for decades that rejection and isolation are just about the worst human experience possible. The experience actually activates the part of the brain that signals physical pain. First of all, it's important to acknowledge that feeling left out is a big deal to a teen. Second, although they might not want to hear it, it's important to remind your kid that there will be more opportunities to spend time with friends in the future and how being left out doesn’t equate to a lack of worth or value. Those messages, given by caring adults over time, will sink in and provide a broader foundation for self-confidence and acceptance. Finally, invite them to become more aware of how their social media use impacts their sense of self-worth. If going on social media on a Friday night leads to feeling left out every time, then perhaps it’s time to make a plan to avoid it. That could include them taking the initiative with a friend or two earlier in the week to make plans to hang out, or it might mean intentionally putting their phone away."

To listen to supportive community stories and helpful information on mental health, say or type'open mental health list' or 'play Daily Routine To Fight Off Depression on YouTube'\n2. Some foods for stress relief are: Snack on Nuts - Penn State researchers found that a couple servings of potassium-packed pistachios a day can lower blood pressure and reduce the strain stress puts on our heart, food with red peppers, two servings a week of wild salmon or other oily fish, bust Out the Spinach, oatmeal - it's is warm and comforting-and it also helps your brain generate the destressing neurotransmitter serotonin, dark chocolate - but it has high-calorie food, so mind your portions, tea - a study from University College London discovered that tea drinkers de-stressed faster and had lower cortisol levels than those who drank a placebo. Although (caffeinated) black tea was used in the study, caffeine revs the stress response in many people, so stick to decaf and herbal teas.\n3. Started with self-care: get regular exercise, eat healthy, regular meals and stay hydrated, make sleep a priority, try a relaxing activity, set goals and priorities, practice gratitude, focus on positivity, stay connected, reach out to your friends or family members who can provide emotional support and practical help.\n4. Use Fitbit smartwatches to understand your stress, and manage its impact on your well-being by adjusting your activity, improving sleep or practicing mindfulness.\n5. Use medication. Researchers believe that the symptoms of mental illness come from chemical imbalances in a person's brain. A medication works on these imbalances to reduce your symptoms, or sometimes, to relieve them completely. It is important to know the benefits of prescribed medications, as well as their potential side effects, and to talk to your doctor about any concerns that you may have. Say or type'open mental health medication' to know detail.\n6. Speaking to someone, whether by going to a therapist or by attending a support group, can help you feel better and improve your mental health. These resources can help you find a psychologist, psychiatrist, or support group near you. Say or type 'open samhsa' or 'open inclusive therapists' to go."

You can also practice playing online poker, but in the U.S., you may not be able to make any money, since banks are banned from dealing with online poker companies. Once you're at a level where you're winning most of the time, start competing in tournaments. To match the biggest bets in a game, you'll need to have enough bankroll, which will usually be about $12,500. Gradually move onto bigger tournaments and casinos until you can live off your winnings. Start out young. 4 out of the 5 last World Series of Poker champions were 25 or under. It seems as though the younger you start, the better your chances of rising to the top. This is likely because the younger you are, the more fearless and aggressive you are, too. It's not enough to know how to play poker. You've got to know strategy, the ins and outs, how to bluff , and how to detect when others are bluffing. In many states, you have to be 21 to enter a casino.\nHowever, in certain states this is not the case and sometimes different rules apply to card rooms. If you're under 21, try to find a place in your area where you're allowed to play with others who take it just as seriously as you do. Get really, really, ridiculously good at poker. We're talking ridiculously good. So good you're profiting more often than not and coming home with significant amounts of change. It doesn't matter if you're playing the same small casino day in and day out, you've gotta be routinely coming out on top. Try to play all types of people. Those you can read, those you can't read, those who stick to the same strategy, those who have no strategy at all have your opponents run the gamut of personalities. When you find a type of person you're weaker against, zero in on them and play them until the weakness goes away. Don't just play hold 'em, either. Know how to play Omaha, 5-card draw, and 7-card stud, too. The more variants you know, the better your skills. And you may run into a tournament of this variation someday, too. Keep track of at least 1,500 hours worth of play. This is where you're going to say, Aww, man, that sounds like work. And it is to make this your living, you gotta put in the grunt work. And that means keeping track of every game you play and the results."],
	"how to handle an emergency situation":[
		"To handle an emergency situation, start by calling 911, or the appropriate emergency services number if you're outside the U.S. If someone is injured, try asking questions like: What's your name? and Where does it hurt? to see if you can help in any way while you wait for the paramedics. Alternatively, if the situation is a workplace emergency like a fire or chemical spill, evacuate the area immediately and get to a safe place, like the parking lot. In a situation where you can't leave the premises, find the safest location within your area, like underneath a desk or table. Remain calm. Although emergencies require rapid action, the most important factor in effectively handling the situation is to keep calm. If you find yourself becoming confused or anxious, stop what you're doing. Take a deep breath. Remember that to be calm in a stressful situation you must deliberately adjust your behavior. Reassure yourself that you can handle the situation. The reason you feel panicked in an emergency is the result of your body's automatic overproduction of the stress hormone cortisol. The cortisol goes to the brain and slows down the pre-frontal cortex, which is the region responsible for planning complex action.\n By overriding your body's reaction, you can continue to access your critical thinking faculties. You won't be responding from emotion, but from rational thought. Look around and assess the situation to see what needs to be done before acting. Seek additional help. In the USA, call 911 for emergency assistance. Use whatever number is applicable to call emergency services outside the U.S. This phone number will reach an emergency dispatcher who will need to know your location and the nature of the emergency. Answer all of the questions the dispatcher asks. If you're calling on a traditional telephone or a GPS-equipped cell phone, emergency services may be able to track your location even if you're unable to speak. Even if you can't talk, call emergency services and someone will be able to find you to provide help. It may be a good idea to go over how you would communicate during an emergency , especially if you have a reason to expect an emergency might arise."

	"how to wake up happy every morning":[
		"If you want to wake up happy every morning, start by making sure that you're getting a good night's sleep. Try going to bed early enough to get 6 to 8 hours of sleep without hitting the snooze button. Once you wake up, take half an hour to sit outside, since studies show that morning light from 6 to 10 a.m. triggers the release of melatonin in our brains. Because rushing can increase stress and forgetfulness, as well as lead to muscle tension, try not to sleep in too late. By waking up earlier, you'll have more time to do things like yoga or stretching, which can help you feel energized and decrease your stress levels. Go to bed at a reasonable time. The first step to waking up happy in the morning is getting to bed the night before. Experts say adults should aim for between six to eight hours nightly, so organize your evening activities around getting a full night sleep. Additionally, experts also recommend finishing the use of electronic devices at least an hour before bedtime to give your brain time to shut down and prepare for sleep. This may be difficult if you work odd shifts or have a new baby to care for, but do your best. Don't sleep with the lights on.\nOther than making it difficult to attain sleep, research indicates that when we sleep or dream in mild to moderate light, we rest less and wake up feeling less happy than we ordinarily would. This includes sleeping in light generated by TVs, computers, nightlights, and streetlights, which have all have been shown to negatively impact mood of sleepers. Try a sleeping mask or blackout curtains to block out light while you sleep. Exposure to light interferes with our body's production of melatonin, which is a hormone that helps control your sleep and wake cycle. Dimming your lighting as you're preparing for bed and making your room as dark as possible can help keep your melatonin production on track. Clear your mind with relaxation techniques. Meditation , deep breathing , or progressive muscle relaxation are ways to help calm anxiety, tension, or troublesome thoughts that might keep you awake. Try incorporating one or more of these practices into your nighttime routine. Sleep on your right side. Want to enjoy peaceful dreams and wake up happy? Researchers have discovered that sleeping on your right side increases the chance that you will have positive dreams and also decreases the likelihood of mood dysfunction throughout the day. Having trouble keeping your sleep position to the right side? Consider purchasing a body pillow. Having it on your left side will shape your sleep posture and prevent you from rolling to the left. Design your room to be conducive to sleep."

	"how to get rid of dry skin":[
		"To get rid of dry skin on your face, start by washing your face with warm water using a mild cleanser that doesn't have fragrances or soap in it. After you wash your face, apply a strong moisturizer to your skin that has ingredients like shea butter, glycerin, and ceramides. Gently exfoliate your face 2-3 times a week with a damp baby's washcloth. Choose a gentle cleanser free from fragrances, alcohol, and dyes. These ingredients may further dry out your skin. Check the label on any facial cleanser you are considering buying to ensure that it does not contain these ingredients. Opt for a cleanser meant for dry skin for best results. For example, you can purchase a soap-free cleanser, such as Cetaphil or Aquanil. Wash your face twice daily with lukewarm water and a gentle cleanser. Wet your face with cool or lukewarm water by cupping the water in your hands and splashing it onto your face. Work the cleanser into your skin with your fingertips using small circular motions. Then, rinse the soap off of your face by wetting it again. Do not scrub your skin with a sponge or washcloth because this will strip extra oils from your skin and dry it out even more. Don't use hot water to wash your face as this may dry out your skin even more. Pat your face dry with a clean towel. After you finish washing and rinsing your face, get a clean, dry towel and pat your face with it. Do not rub the towel against your skin as this will dry it out more. Gently pat your face all over with the towel to dry it off. You can use a regular towel, or try a microfiber towel or T-shirt for an even softer option. Select a moisturizer that includes oil or shea butter or other emollients. These ingredients work well for treating dry skin on your face. Look at the label to check for 1 or both of these ingredients. You may also want to choose a cream or ointment moisturizer rather than a lotion. Look for something that is labeled as intensive or that is meant for treating dry skin. Other ingredients that may help to moisturize dry skin include dimethicone, glycerin, hyaluronic acid, lactic acid, lanolin, mineral oil, petrolatum, and urea. Check the ingredients on moisturizers you consider buying to see if it contains any of these ingredients. Apply moisturizer to your face right after cleansing. This is the best time to lock in moisture and get rid of dry skin. Apply enough moisturizer to your skin to fully coat it, and then let the moisturizer sit on your skin until your skin absorbs it. Use your fingertips to smooth the moisturizer all over your face and neck. You may only need a pea-sized amount to cover your whole face, so start with that amount and then apply more moisturizer if needed. Apply aloe vera gel to your skin for extra moisture."

	"how to get bad cholesterol down":[
		"To get your bad cholesterol down, try eating less red meat, dairy products, and eggs, since these foods are often high in saturated fats and can raise your cholesterol. Instead, try eating more foods high in soluble fiber, like oatmeal, kidney beans, apples, and bananas, which help absorb bad cholesterol. Besides eating low-cholesterol foods, you should exercise at least 30 minutes a day to help you maintain a healthy weight. If you don't have time to exercise, you can squeeze in some physical activity by taking 10-minute walks a few times throughout the day. Make sure to talk to your doctor if you aren't able to lower your cholesterol on your own to see if you need medication. Cut high-cholesterol foods from your diet. Consume fewer foods derived from animals, like meats (especially red meats), dairy products, and eggs. These can be high in saturated fats, therefore raising bad cholesterol. Even if you've been eating unhealthily for years, it's never too late to modify your diet and make healthy changes. Saturated fats are solid at room temperature as opposed to healthier unhydrogenated fats, as those found in olive oil. An example of a saturated fat would be lard. Avoid eating trans fats, too, like margarine, packaged cookies, cakes, and crackers. These items raise LDL and lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL), which is known as good cholesterol. Trans fats may appear on labels as partially hydrogenated oil.\nA food that claims to be 'trans fat-free' may in fact contain up to 0.5 grams of partially hydrogenated oils per serving. Check the serving size as well, as people often consume more than one serving in a sitting. Try adding whey protein to your diet. Whey protein is one of the two proteins found in dairy products. Adding it to your diet can offer the health benefits of dairy, without the added cholesterol and fat that can be found in many dairy products. Powdered whey protein is available at grocery and health food stores. Instructions on the product's label will tell you how to use it. Choose low-fat dairy when consuming whey based products, as these contain less animal-based fat (saturated fat). Add soluble fiber to your diet. Soluble fiber helps reduce absorption of cholesterol into the bloodstream, so add high-fiber foods to your diet. The best strategy to add fiber to your meals is by eating more grains and fruits. Consider choices like oatmeal, oat bran, whole grain cold cereals, kidney beans, apple, pears, bananas, and prunes. 5 to 10 grams of soluble fiber per day effectively decreases your LDL cholesterol levels. Every 1 1/2 cups of oatmeal, for example, equals 6 grams of fiber. Use more olive oil. Olive oil contains antioxidants, which help lower bad cholesterol. Swap out other fats in your diet, butter in particular, for about 2 tablespoons of olive oil daily. Extra-virgin olive oil is considered best, as it is the least processed. Swap out creamier, fattier salad dressings for a little oil and vinegar."

	"how to treat excessive flatulence in cats":[
		"If you think your cat's flatulence problem might be related to diet, pay attention to how much it eats and when, and see if there's a clear relationship between the food and the gas. You can also check the litter box for other evidence of digestive issues, such as diarrhea or stool with mucus or blood in it. If you notice any of these symptoms, call your vet. In the meantime, try gradually switching your cat to a food that is low in fiber and high in protein. Watch out for ingredients like wheat, corn, and soybeans, which can make gas worse. Additionally, you can try feeding your cat several small meals throughout the day instead of 1 or 2 big ones. This may help your cat digest its food more effectively. Monitor what your cat eats for a day or two. To figure out if the problem is related to the food, you should keep a record of your cat's food and eating habits for a day or two. This can give you a complete view of their foods so you can figure out what is causing the gas. Make sure not to change anything for a day or two so you can try to get an accurate idea of the causes. Check your cat's feces. Soft stools, diarrhea, blood, or mucus in the poop can be a sign of poor bowel health, which could be causing your cat's excessive flatulence. If you notice these symptoms, you need to take your cat to the vet for a proper diagnosis. Tell the receptionist the symptoms when you call to make an appointment. Don't wait to take your cat in to see the vet. Starting treatment earlier will give your cat a better chance at recovery. Change your cat food. A food that is lower in fiber may be more digestible for your cat. Foods high in fiber that can't be digested may linger in the digestive tract and ferment, which can cause gas. Foods that contain high amounts of wheat, corn, and soybeans can cause gas."

	"how to avoid food poisoning":[
		"To avoid food poisoning, always eat your food right after it's been served so germs don't have time to grow on it. Also, try to avoid raw fish, meat, and eggs since these raw foods can have dangerous bacteria growing on them. If you're eating packaged food, always check the expiration date first to make sure the food is still fresh. You should also make sure that any leftovers you're considering eating have been properly stored in the fridge or freezer. Finally, always wash your hands before eating so you don't accidentally contaminate your food. Shop with care. Food safety begins at the grocery store, so make sure to shop wisely: Check the use-by dates on all products and use your judgement to decide if foods have been stored at the correct temperatures. Pack meat and poultry products into separate bags and do not let the raw flesh touch any other food products as you shop or bring them home. Maintain the cold chain. Keep cold and frozen foods as cold as possible, especially when transferring from the store to your home.\nThis prevents the growth of pesky bacteria that could cause food poisoning. Here are ways to keep your food safe: Wrap the goods in newspaper or buy a small cooler bag to transport your cold and frozen foods home. When using coolers, always separate meat from other cold items. You should label your coolers so you always put the right items in the right cooler. Clean the coolers after each use with disinfecting cloths. When possible, leave grabbing cold products to the end of your shopping. Store all foods properly and quickly when you get back home. Always wash your hands before and after preparing foods. Wash your hands thoroughly with hot water and antibacterial soap before and after preparing food, especially after handling raw meat. Dry your hands on a clean towel that's separate from the 1 you use to wipe down surfaces. Keep dish cloths and hand towels regularly cleaned to prevent bacteria from accumulating on the fabric. Always wash your hands after handling pets (especially reptiles, turtles and birds) and after using the bathroom or handling pet litter. Keep your kitchen clean."

		"If your cat has stopped eating its normal food, check to see if there's a recall on that particular food. It's another good reason why you should consider keeping your cat's dry food in its original bag so you can check the bar code. Sometimes a cat can sense that something is wrong with their food and won't eat it.\nDepending on the reason why your cat has stopped eating, you may be able to coax your kitty to start eating again. However, it’s not normal for a cat to stop eating if their food has not changed, so a trip to your veterinarian is recommended to rule out medical reasons.If an upper respiratory disease has caused your cat to be congested and unable to smell its food, your vet may recommend at-home treatment to help clear your cat’s nasal passages. This may involve nebulizing your cat in a steamy bathroom or placing saline drops in its nostrils. This breaks up the nasal discharge and helps your cat breathe easily so it can once again smell its food.\nTweak your cat's wet food to entice it to eat again. Try heating up cold wet cat food or tuna for a few seconds in the microwave. Or, offer your cat canned kitten food, canned tuna, or canned chicken to whet your pet's appetite.\nuhmmm...Experiment by choosing a different flavor, texture, or shape of food to feed your cat.\nMake cat food from scratch.

Keep to a feeding schedule designed for your pet's size and age - For example: Puppies and kittens under 3 months: Feed 4 times a day, several hours apart, starting in the early morning, Puppies and kittens between 3-6 months: Shift to 3 meals a day, as they are now able to maintain their nutrient levels longer, 6 Months and older: Split up your pet's daily calories into 1-2 meals, depending on your and your pet's preferences. Keep track of all treats, and keep them small, Try low-calorie treats, Use some of your pet's daily kibble as treats, Only use treats as a positive reward, Create a game that challenges pets to work for treats.\nUp the exercise to burn some calories and keep your pet moving - Exercise for dogs: Take a walk around the neighborhood. Walking has less impact on the joints, so this is a good first activity for a dog that has been inactive for a long time; Go for a swim. Swimming exercises the muscles without undue impact, so it can be a good option for dogs with arthritis. (Just be sure to dry their ears afterwards.); Play fetch. This is a higher impact activity, but watching ball-crazy pets can be a reward in itself.\nExercise for cats: Play with a favorite toy. Fishing rod toys, with a toy on a string, are great ways to invite your cat to come play; Cat trees. Help your cat to safely climb and scratch; Move the food.

The lining of the sinuses are made up of cells with tiny hairs on their surfaces called cilia.  Other cells in the lining produce mucus.  The mucus traps germs and pollutants and the cilia push the mucus out through narrow sinus openings into the nose. When the sinuses become inflamed or infected, the mucus thickens and clogs the openings to one or more sinuses. Fluid builds up inside the sinuses causing increased pressure. Also bacteria can become trapped, multiply and infect the lining. This is sinusitis."

    "Adenocarcinoma of the lung": [
        "Adenocarcinoma of the lung is a type of non-small cell lung cancer. It occurs when abnormal lung cells multiply out of control and form a tumor. Eventually, tumor cells can spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body including the: lymph nodes around and between the lungs, liver, bones, adrenal glands, brain. Adenocarcinoma is the most common form of lung cancer. It's generally found in smokers. However, it is the most common type of lung cancer in nonsmokers. It is also the most common form of lung cancer in women and people younger than 45.Compared with other types of lung cancer, adenocarcinoma is more likely to be contained in one area. If it is truly localized, it may respond to treatment better than other lung cancers."

Age spots (also called liver spots or solar lentigo) are collections of pigment caused by exposure to the sun. Pigment is deposited as a response to injury, just like a scar is a response to a cut. The pigment collects in areas injured because of thin skin or greater sun exposure. Age spots also can be caused by bruising that leaves blood pigment behind. They are most common in people older than 55. The spots commonly appear on the hands, but they can be almost anywhere, especially sun-exposed areas, such as the face, back, arms, feet and shoulders."

    "Alcoholism": [
        "In an alcohol use disorder (AUD, commonly called alcoholism), excessive alcohol use causes symptoms affecting the body, thoughts and behavior. A hallmark of the disorder is that the person continues to drink despite the problems that alcohol causes. There is no absolute number of drinks per day or quantity of alcohol that defines an alcohol use disorder, but above a certain level, the risks of drinking increase significantly. Here are some defining characteristics of alcohol dependence: Drinking more than intended. Loss of control over the amount of alcohol used. Desire to stop drinking but inability to do so. Excessive time spent getting or using alcohol or recovering from its effects. Craving or preoccupation with drinking. Problems stemming from alcohol use; ignoring those problems; drinking despite obvious hazards, including physical danger. Retreating from important work, family or social activities and roles. Tolerance – The need to drink more and more alcohol to feel the same effects, or the ability to drink more than other people without getting drunk. Withdrawal symptoms – After stopping or cutting back on drinking, symptoms are anxiety, sweating, trembling, trouble sleeping, nausea or vomiting, and in severe cases, physical seizures and hallucinations. The person may drink to relieve or avoid such symptoms."

    "Alcohol withdrawal": [
        "Alcohol withdrawal is the changes the body goes through when a person suddenly stops drinking after prolonged and heavy alcohol use. Symptoms include trembling (shakes), insomnia, anxiety, and other physical and mental symptoms. Alcohol has a slowing effect (also called a sedating effect or depressant effect) on the brain. In a heavy, long-term drinker, the brain is almost continually exposed to the depressant effect of alcohol. Over time, the brain adjusts its own chemistry to compensate for the effect of the alcohol. It does this by producing naturally stimulating chemicals (such as serotonin or norepinephrine, which is a relative of adrenaline) in larger quantities than normal."

    "Allergy": [
        "An allergy is an immune system reaction to something that is normally harmless. The reaction to the allergen (allergy-triggering substance) results in the release of histamine and other body chemicals. These chemicals cause the symptoms of allergies, which are usually mild but annoying. Examples include the runny nose of hay fever (allergic rhinitis) or the itchy rash of poison ivy. However, in some cases, the symptoms can be much worse and involve the entire body. Anaphylaxis is the most severe allergic reaction. In anaphylaxis, these immune chemicals cause serious skin symptoms, such as hives and swelling, as well as severe breathing problems and very low blood pressure."

    "Alopecia areata": [
        "Alopecia areata is a skin disorder that causes hair loss, usually in patches, most often on the scalp. Usually, the bald patches appear suddenly and affect only a limited area. The hair grows back within 12 months or less. For some people, however, the problem can last longer and be more severe, causing total baldness (alopecia totalis) or total loss of body hair (alopecia universalis). The cause of alopecia areata is probably an autoimmune reaction. This means the body's immune system incorrectly attacks the body's own cells. In the case of alopecia areata, the cells under attack are in the hair follicles (structures that grow hair), especially follicles within the scalp."

    "altitude sickness": [
        "At higher altitudes, the pressure of the air around you (barometric pressure) decreases so there is less oxygen in surrounding air. People can live comfortably at moderately high altitudes, but the body must make some adjustments, and this takes time. If you ascend to altitudes above 8,000 feet, you will be in danger of developing uncomfortable or dangerous symptoms from the change in altitude. Symptoms of altitude sickness that are not life threatening are called acute mountain sickness. Mountain climbers on any high mountain and skiers in high-altitude locations such as Colorado are at risk of developing acute mountain sickness. Symptoms from acute mountain sickness improve if you descend to lower altitude quickly. For very mild symptoms, a delay before further climbing may be enough to allow symptoms to go away."

    "Anal cancer": [
        "Anal cancer is an uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the anus. The anus is the end of the large intestine, through which solid waste leaves the body. The treatments for anal cancer and rectal cancer can differ. Doctors need to know the exact location and the specific type of cell that has become cancerous in order to choose the right treatment. The body stores digestive waste (feces) in the rectum, the lower part of the large intestine. The feces travel through the anal canal, a short tube that connects the rectum to the anal opening where they are passed as a bowel movement."

    "Anal Disorders": [
        "The anus is that part of the intestinal tract that passes through the muscular canal of the pelvis and anal sphincters. It is the final orifice through which stool passes out of the body. In adults, the anus is 4 to 5 centimeters long. The lower half of the anal canal has sensitive nerve endings. There are blood vessels under the lining, and in its mid portion there are numerous tiny, anal glands. This article describes four disorders that cause anal pain and irritation: Anal fissure - An anal fissure, also called an anorectal fissure, is a linear split or tear in the lining ('anoderm') of the lower anal canal, Anal abscess - An anal abscess is a swollen, painful collection of pus near the anus. Most anal abscesses are not related to other health problems and arise spontaneously, for reasons that are unclear, Anal fistula - An anal fistula is an abnormal narrow tunnel-like passageway, which is the remnant of an old anal abscess after it has drained, Hemorrhoids - Hemorrhoids do not ordinarily cause pain. Nevertheless, sometime the blood vessels in a small hemorrhoid at the edge of the anal orifice can clot off ('thrombosis'). Symptoms: Although all four anal disorders cause some type of anal discomfort or pain, other symptoms vary, depending on the specific anal problem."

Anal itch is a symptom, not an illness, and it can have many different causes. In most cases, a person with anal itch does not have a disease of the anus or rectum. Instead, the itchy sensation is a sign that one or more of the following has irritated the skin in the area: Stool on the skin around the anal opening — If the anal area isn't cleaned properly after a bowel movement, a small amount of stool may be left behind on the skin, causing the area to itch, A diet containing foods or beverages that irritate the anus — A number of foods and drinks can irritate the anus, including  spices and spicy foods, coffee (both caffeinated and decaffeinated), tea, cola, milk, alcoholic beverages (especially beer and wine), chocolate, citrus fruits, vitamin C tablets and tomatoes, Treatment with antibiotics — Some powerful antibiotics that work against many different bacterial species can trigger anal itch by disturbing the normal ecology of the intestines, A local chemical irritation or skin allergy in the anal area — In sensitive people, chemicals and medications that are applied to the anal area can cause local irritation or allergic reactions, Intense cleaning after a bowel movement — Although the anal area should be cleaned after every bowel movement, this cleaning must be gentle."

    "Anaphylaxis": [
        "Anaphylaxis is a severe, sometimes life-threatening, allergic reaction that occurs within minutes to several hours of exposure an allergy-causing substance (allergen). Anaphylaxis also is called anaphylactic shock. In an allergic reaction, the body's immune system responds to the presence of an allergen by releasing histamine and other body chemicals. These chemicals cause the symptoms of allergies, which are usually mild but annoying, such as the runny nose of hay fever (allergic rhinitis) or the itchy rash of poison ivy. However, in some cases, the symptoms can be much worse and involve the entire body. Anaphylaxis is the most severe allergic reaction. In anaphylaxis, these immune chemicals cause serious skin symptoms, such as hives and swelling, as well as severe breathing problems, such as swelling in the throat, narrowing of the lower airways and wheezing). The chemicals also cause blood vessels to widen dramatically, which leads to a rapid, severe drop in blood pressure (shock). Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening medical emergency."

The tibia's lower end flares out, forming a hard, bony knob, called the medial malleolus, which you can feel at the inside of your ankle. The fibula — This is the thinner of the two bones of the lower leg. Its lower end forms a hard, bony knob, called the lateral malleolus, which you can feel at the outside of your ankle. The talus — This is a wedge-shaped bone that is located deep inside the ankle, braced between the heel bone and the ends of the tibia and fibula. The talus supports the lower ends of the tibia and fibula, and it forms a solid base for the normal range of ankle movements."

It protects these structures and helps to transmit light through the eye. The cornea is normally spherical, although in people with astigmatism, it may be shaped like a football or oval. This causes light to scatter instead of focus on a single point as it passes through the cornea, resulting in blurred vision. Many people have some degree of astigmatism. In fact, it is rare to find a perfectly formed eye. Astigmatism is thought to be hereditary, so if you have astigmatism, chances are good your children will have it also. The condition often occurs with other vision conditions such as nearsightedness (myopia). Many people confuse astigmatism with 'lazy eye' (amblyopia). They are not the same condition though severe astigmatism can contribute to amblyopia."

    "Atherosclerosis": [
        "Atherosclerosis is a narrowing of the arteries that can significantly reduce the blood supply to vital organs such as the heart, brain and intestines. In atherosclerosis, the arteries are narrowed when fatty deposits called plaques build up inside. Plaques typically contain cholesterol from low-density lipoproteins (LDL), smooth-muscle cells and fibrous tissue, and sometimes calcium. As a plaque grows along the lining of an artery, it produces a rough area in the artery's normally smooth surface. This rough area can cause a blood clot to form inside the artery, which can totally block blood flow. As a result, the organ supplied by the blocked artery starves for blood and oxygen. The organ's cells may either die or suffer severe damage."

        "Bipolar disorder, which used to be called manic depressive illness or manic depression, is a mental disorder characterized by wide mood swings from high (manic) to low (depressed). Periods of high or irritable mood are called manic episodes. The person becomes very active, but in a scattered and unproductive way, sometimes with painful or embarrassing consequences. Examples are spending more money than is wise or getting involved in sexual adventures that are regretted later. A person in a manic state is full of energy or very irritable, may sleep far less than normal, and may dream up grand plans that could never be carried out. The person may develop thinking that is out of step with reality -- psychotic symptoms -- such as false beliefs (delusions) or false perceptions (hallucinations). During manic periods, a person may run into trouble with the law. If a person has milder symptoms of mania and does not have psychotic symptoms, it is called 'hypomania' or a hypomanic episode."

    "Black Eye": [
        "A black eye, sometimes called a 'shiner', is a bruise around the eye. When an object strikes the eye, the force of the impact breaks delicate blood vessels in the eyelids and surrounding tissues. Blood collects under the skin, and causes black or blue discoloration in the eyelids and around the eye socket. Because the skin around the eye is relatively thin and transparent compared to skin in other parts of the body, the black and blue color of a bruised eye may seem darker and more intense than bruises elsewhere. Although many people associate black eyes with fighting and violence, only about 15% of eye injuries are caused by violent assaults. Most black eyes happen by accident — during contact sports, at work, in a car crash or during home repair. Men get about four times more eye injuries than women do, and the average patient is approximately 30 years old. The source of the injury is usually a blunt object — a baseball, a hammer, a rock or a piece of lumber — and the most frequent place of injury is the home."

    "Bladder Cancer": [
        "This type of cancer occurs in the bladder — the organ that stores urine. The bladder has an inner lining surrounded by a layer of muscle. Bladder cancer begins in the inner lining of the bladder. It is usually discovered before it has spread past this lining. Risk factors for bladder cancer include: Cancer-causing substances such as tobacco smoke and chemicals in the environment, Exposure to certain industrial chemicals, Long-standing bladder stones. Bladder cancer tends to return in people who have had the disease."
    ],
    "Bladder Infection": [
        "A bladder infection, also called cystitis, is caused by an abnormal growth of bacteria inside the bladder, the balloon-like organ that stores urine. Bladder infections are one of the most common bacterial infections to affect humans, with up to one-third of all females having at least one infection at some point in their lives. Bladder infections are classified as either simple or complicated. Simple bladder infections affect only healthy women with normal urinary systems."
    ],
    "Blisters": [
        "A blister is a bubble of fluid under the skin. The clear, watery liquid inside a blister is called serum. It leaks in from neighboring tissues as a reaction to injured skin. If the blister remains unopened, serum can provide natural protection for the skin beneath it. Small blisters are called vesicles. Those larger than half an inch are called bullae. A blood blister is filled with blood, rather than serum. There are many causes of blisters, including: Irritation — Blisters can be caused by physical factors that irritate the skin, such as friction (rubbing the skin), irritating chemicals or extreme cold or heat, Allergies — Allergic contact dermatitis, a form of dermatitis or eczema, may result in blisters, Infections — Infections that cause blisters include bullous impetigo, an infection of the skin caused by staphylococci (staph) bacteria; viral infections of the lips and genital area due to the herpes simplex virus (types 1 and 2); chickenpox and shingles, Skin diseases — Numerous skin diseases cause blisters. Examples include dermatitis herpetiformis, pemphigoid and pemphigus, Medications — Many medications, such as nalidixic acid (NegGram) and furosemide (Lasix), can cause mild, blistering skin reactions. Others, such as the doxycycline (Vibramycin), can increase the risk of blistering sunburn by increasing the skin's sensitivity to sunlight."

    "Body Lice": [
        "Body lice are small, parasitic insects found mainly on the clothing of infested people, and occasionally on their bodies or bedding. They spend most of their life on an infested person's clothing, crawling onto the skin to feed on the host's blood one or more times a day. Female lice glue their eggs on the seams of clothing worn near the skin, where body heat allows them to hatch in about a week. Hatchlings develop to the adult stage in about nine days if they remain close to the host and have access to blood."

    "Borderline Personality Disorder": [
        "Borderline personality disorder is characterized by poor self-image, a feeling of emptiness, and great difficulty coping with being alone. People with this disorder have highly reactive and intense moods, and unstable relationships. Their behavior can be impulsive. They are also more likely than average to attempt or commit suicide. Sometimes, without intending to commit suicide, they harm themselves (for example, cutting or burning) as a form of self-punishment or to combat an empty feeling. When stressed, people with borderline personality disorder may develop psychotic-like symptoms. They experience a distortion of their perceptions or beliefs rather than a distinct break with reality. Especially in close relationships, they tend to misinterpret or amplify what other people feel about them. For example, they may assume a friend or family member is having extremely hateful feelings toward them, when the person may be only mildly annoyed or angry."

    "Coronavirus": [
        "Coronavirus disease or COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV2 virus. Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID19 and become seriously ill or die at any age."
    ],
    "Botulism": [
        "Botulism is a form of poisoning caused by exposure to Clostridium botulinum bacteria. These bacteria manufacture a chemical poison known as botulinum toxin that interferes with muscle function in many areas of the body, causing paralysis of individual muscles or groups of muscles. Exposure to this toxin is life threatening, since one of the muscles it can paralyze is the diaphragm, the muscle that controls breathing."
    ],
    "Bowel Obstruction": [
        "In a bowel obstruction (intestinal obstruction), a blockage prevents the contents of the intestines from passing normally through the digestive tract. The problem causing the blockage can be inside or outside the intestine. Inside the intestine, a tumor or swelling can fill and block the inside passageway of the intestine. Outside the intestine, it is possible for an adjacent organ or area of tissue to pinch, compress or twist a segment of bowel. A bowel obstruction can occur in the small bowel (small intestine) or large bowel (large intestine or colon). Also, a bowel obstruction can be total or partial, depending on whether any intestinal contents can pass through the obstructed area."
    ],
    "Bradycardia": [
        "Bradycardia is an abnormally slow heart rate of less than 60 beats per minute. A normal heartbeat is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. Here's what happens during a normal heartbeat: The electrical signal that starts a heartbeat comes from the heart's sinus node, the natural pacemaker located in the upper portion of the right atrium. From the sinus node, the heartbeat signal travels to the atrioventricular (A-V) node, located between the atria, and then through the bundle of His (pronounced 'hiss') - a series of modified heart-muscle fibers located between the ventricles -- to the muscles of the ventricles. This triggers a contraction of the ventricles and produces a heartbeat."

    "Brain Abscess": [
        "A brain abscess is a collection of pus enclosed in the brain tissue, caused by a bacterial or fungal infection. A brain abscess can develop as a complication of an infection, trauma or surgery. They are rare, although people with weakened immune systems (such as people with HIV or those who have received an organ transplant) are more likely to get a brain abscess."
    ],
    "Brain Tumor": [
        "A brain tumor is a mass of abnormally growing cells in the brain or skull. It can be benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Unlike other cancers, a cancer arising from brain tissue (a primary brain cancer) rarely spreads. Whether benign or malignant, all brain tumors are serious. A growing tumor eventually will compress and damage other structures in the brain. There are two categories of brain tumors: primary and secondary. Primary tumors start in brain tissue, while secondary tumors spread to the brain from another area of the body."
    ],
    "Breast Cancer": [
        "Breast cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells that can develop in one of several areas of the breast, including: the ducts that carry milk to the nipple, small sacs that produce milk (lobules), non-glandular tissue. Breast cancer is considered invasive when the cancer cells have penetrated the lining of the ducts or lobules. That means the cancer cells can be found in the surrounding tissues, such as fatty and connective tissues or the skin. Noninvasive breast cancer (in situ) occurs when cancer cells fill the ducts or lobules but haven't spread into surrounding tissue."
    ],
    "Broken Jaw": [
        "When a bone breaks or cracks, the injury is called a fracture. Jaw fractures are the third most common type of facial fractures, after fractures of the nose and cheekbone. They can be caused by many different types of impacts to the lower face, including: an accidental fall, especially in children who are playing and in adults who faint, hitting the dashboard during a car accident, a fall from a motorcycle or bicycle, a fall or collision during contact sports, a punch to the jaw. The jaw bone is also called the mandible. It is a long bone that includes your chin and angles up toward your ear on both sides of your face. On each side, the end of the jawbone is rounded like a ball. This 'ball' called the condyle, is the part of the jaw joint right in front of your ear. It lets you open and close your mouth. The jaw joint is also called the temporomandibular joint or TMJ."
    ],
    "Broken Nose": [
        "A broken nose is a fracture (crack or break) of the nasal bones. In most cases, there is also some damage to nearby nasal cartilage, particularly the nasal septum, the flexible partition that divides the left and right sides of the nose. Because the nose has such a prominent and unprotected position in the center of the face, it is particularly vulnerable to impacts from accidents and violence. In mild fractures, the injury causes only some mild swelling and a brief nosebleed, so you may be unaware of the break unless your nose heals with a slight deformity."

    "Bulimia": [
        "The main characteristics of the eating disorder, bulimia nervosa, are: Repetitive binge eating, Compensatory behavior to prevent weight gain, Exaggerated preoccupied with body shape and weight. During a binge, a person eats large quantities of food in a relatively short time, regardless of hunger. Binge eating is defined only in part by food quantity. A more important feature is the person's state of mind: During a binge, the person with bulimia feels out of control of the eating and cannot stop it."

    "Bunion": [
        "A bunion is a firm bump that forms over a bony bulge at the base of the big toe. In most cases, the big toe joint also is enlarged and has degenerative arthritis. The toe also may be pushed toward the second toe (hallux valgus).  Bunions are often painful, especially when wearing stiff shoes that press on the bump."
    ],
    "Bursitis": [
        "A bursa is a membrane near a joint that acts as a cushion between the muscle and bone. The bursa reduces friction caused by movement and makes the joint more flexible. Bursitis is inflammation of a bursa. It is a common condition that often happens when a joint is overused, such as when throwing a baseball or painting a wall. More rarely, bursitis can be caused by gout or an infection. Bursitis is more common in people who are overweight, elderly or diabetic, although it also develops in younger, healthy people without a clear reason."

    "Campylobacteriosis": [
        "Campylobacteriosis is an infection by one of several species of Campylobacter bacteria, particularly Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni). This infection typically causes diarrhea. The infection also can cause fever and abdominal cramps. Humans usually become infected with Campylobacter after eating poorly prepared meat, especially undercooked chicken. Campylobacter is one of the most common bacterial causes of food-borne illness."
    ],
    "Cancer": [
        "Cancer is not a single disease. It's a group of diseases characterized by their ability to cause cells to change abnormally and grow out of control. Most types of cancer form a tumor, a lump or mass of cancerous cells. Cells from a tumor may break away and travel to other parts of the body, where they can settle and multiply. This spreading process is called metastasis. New cancers that have broken off and spread from the original tumor are called metastases."
    ],
    "Candidiasis": [
        "Candidiasis is an infection caused by Candida fungi, most of by Candida albicans. These fungi are found almost everywhere in the environment. Some may live harmlessly along with the abundant 'native' species of bacteria that normally colonize the mouth, gastrointestinal tract and vagina. Usually, Candida is kept under control by the native bacteria and by the body's immune defenses. If the mix of native bacteria is changed by antibiotics or the body moisture that surrounds native bacteria undergoes changes in its acidity or chemistry, it can allow yeast to thrive and cause symptoms."

    "Carbon Monoxide Poisoning": [
        "Carbon monoxide is a tasteless, colorless, odorless gas found in the fumes of fuels that contain carbon, such as wood, coal and gasoline. Carbon monoxide poisoning is a potentially fatal illness that occurs when people breathe in carbon monoxide. All sorts of sources can release carbon monoxide, including cars, trucks, small gasoline engines (like lawnmowers), stoves, lanterns, furnaces, grills, gas ranges, water heaters and clothes dryers. The risk of poisoning is especially high when equipment is used in an enclosed place and ventilation is poor. Carbon monoxide poisoning can occur in victims of smoke inhalation during a fire. More than one-third of carbon monoxide-related deaths occur when the victim is asleep."
    ],
    "Cardiac Arrhythmias": [
        "A cardiac arrhythmia is any abnormal heart rate or rhythm. In normal adults, the heart beats regularly at a rate of 60 to 100 times per minute. And the pulse (felt at the wrist, neck or elsewhere) matches the contractions of the heart's two powerful lower chambers, called the ventricles. The heart's two upper chambers, called the atria, also contract to help fill the ventricles. But this milder contraction occurs just before the ventricles contract, and it is not felt in the pulse."
    ],
    "Cardiomyopathy": [
        "Cardiomyopathy refers to changes in the heart muscle. These changes prevent part or all of the heart from contracting normally. There are three types of cardiomyopathy. The types are based on the physical changes that occur in the heart: Dilated cardiomyopathy — The damaged heart muscle stretches out of shape. The heart becomes enlarged, Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy — The muscular heart wall thickens abnormally. As a result, the heart muscle cannot relax fully. As a result, the heart does not fill up with as much blood as in a healthy heart, Restrictive cardiomyopathy — Various diseases can cause substances to be deposited where they do not belong: in the heart muscle.  This causes the heart's muscular walls to become so rigid that the heart cannot expand to fill up with all the blood that is returning from the body. The best way to prevent cardiomyopathy is to prevent the diseases that cause it. Know your risk factors for coronary artery disease. Modify those risks early in life. You can reduce your risk for coronary artery disease by: Keeping blood pressure normal. Eat a diet rich in vegetables and fruits. Take medication as needed. Drinking no more than two alcoholic beverages per day. Do not drink alcohol at all if you are at high risk of dilated cardiomyopathy. If you have any family members with inherited cardiomyopathy, contact your doctor for an evaluation."

    "Carpal Tunnel Syndrome": [
        "In the wrist, nerves and tendons pass through a space called the carpal tunnel. Because the carpal tunnel is somewhat narrow, a major nerve called the median nerve that passes through this tight space, can become irritated or compressed. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a combination of numbness, tingling, pain and weakness in the hand caused by compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel."

    "Cataracts": [
        "The eye's lens is a transparent structure that focuses images on the light-sensitive retina. Cataracts are cloudy areas in the lens. They occur when certain proteins in the lens form abnormal clumps. These clumps gradually get larger and interfere with vision. They distort or block the passage of light through the lens. 'Cataract' means 'huge waterfall' or 'enormous downpour', which is how some people describe their clouded sight, like trying to look through a waterfall. In many cases, cataracts are age-related."

    "Celiac Disease": [
        "Celiac disease (also called non-tropical sprue, celiac sprue, gluten intolerance and gluten-sensitive enteropathy) is an intestinal disorder in which the body cannot tolerate gluten. Gluten is a natural protein in many grains, including wheat, barley, rye and oats. People with celiac disease have an immune reaction that is triggered by gluten. The immune reaction causes inflammation at the surface of the small intestine where it damages small structures - villi - on the surface of the intestine. It also damages smaller, hair-sized protrusions called microvilli. Healthy villi and microvilli are needed for normal digestion. When they are damaged, the intestine cannot absorb nutrients properly and you can become malnourished."

    "Cellulitis": [
        "Cellulitis is a serious bacterial infection of the skin. Bacteria break through the skin's protective outer layer, typically at the site of an injury, such as a cut, puncture, sore, burn or bite. Cellulitis can occur at the site of surgery, or where there is a catheter. Once beneath the skin surface, bacteria multiply and make chemicals that cause inflammation in the skin. Cellulitis that is not caused by a wound or catheter most often occurs on the legs and feet. However, it can develop on any part of the body, including the trunk, arms and face. It often develops where there is edema (swelling), poor blood flow, or a skin rash that creates breaks in the skin, such as a fungus infection between the toes (athlete's foot)."

    "Cerebral Palsy": [
        "Cerebral palsy is the name given to a large group of disorders that affect muscles and movement. These disorders begin early in life and result from brain injuries or problems with brain development before birth. Although the specific brain injury or problem causing cerebral palsy does not worsen, the movement problems can vary over time. Cerebral palsy is caused by damage to the parts of the brain that control muscles and movement. There are many possible ways that the brain can be damaged, including problems during pregnancy, infection, stroke, genetic problems, lack of oxygen, severe jaundice or diseases that cause the brain to develop abnormally."

    "Cervical Cancer": [
        "The cervix is a small, donut-shaped structure. It is located at the top of the vagina. It is the entrance to the uterus. Cervical cancer begins in the outer layer of the cervix. This outer layer is called the cervical epithelium. Tiny changes begin in epithelial cells. Over time, cells may become cancerous and grow out of control."

    "Cervical Polyps": [
        "The cervix is a tube-like channel that connects the uterus to the vagina. Cervical polyps are growths that usually appear on the cervix where it opens into the vagina. Polyps are usually cherry-red to reddish-purple or grayish-white. They vary in size and often look like bulbs on thin stems. Cervical polyps are usually not cancerous (benign) and can occur alone or in groups. Most polyps are small, about 1 centimeter to 2 centimeters long. Because rare types of cancerous conditions can look like polyps, all polyps should be removed and examined for signs of cancer."

    "Cervicitis": [
        "The cervix is the donut-shaped opening to the uterus. Cervicitis is an inflammation and irritation of the cervix. Symptoms of cervicitis can be similar to vaginitis, with vaginal discharge, itching or pain with intercourse. Cervicitis can be caused by a sexually transmitted infection. Most common are chlamydia and gonorrhea. Trichomoniasis and genital herpes can also cause cervicitis. In some cases, cervicitis is not caused by infection. It may be due to trauma, frequent douching or exposure to chemical irritants."

    "Chemical Injury to the eye": [
        "Eyes can be damaged by solid, liquid, powder or aerosol chemicals. Chemical injuries that happen in the home are most likely to be caused by soaps, disinfectants, solvents, cosmetics, drain cleaners, oven cleaners, ammonia and bleach. In agricultural settings, fertilizers or pesticides can cause eye damage. In industry, many irritating chemicals and solvents can injure the eye. A chemical eye injury is an emergency. Damage can occur within one to five minutes. Most of the time, however, chemicals that come in contact with the eye cause only surface damage and no loss of vision. Caustic (alkaline) chemicals cause the worst damage. These include ammonia, drain cleaners, automatic dish washing detergents and oven cleaners."

    "Chlamydia": [
        "Chlamydia is a sexually transmitted infection spread by having unprotected sex with someone infected with bacteria called Chlamydia trachomatis. These bacteria are found in the urine and genital secretions of infected people. Chlamydia can affect several areas of the reproductive system, causing urethritis, vaginitis, cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Chlamydia also can cause eye infections and pneumonia in newborns delivered by mothers who have chlamydia. Chlamydia is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections. Infections occur most often in unmarried people under age 25 who have had two or more sex partners during the previous year. In women, chlamydia that is not treated can lead to infertility, chronic pelvic pain and tubal pregnancy, in which the fertilized egg implants and grows in the fallopian tube, rather than the uterus."

    "Cholecystitis": [
        "Cholecystitis is an inflammation of the gallbladder. The gallbladder is the small sac-like organ located in the upper right side of the abdomen, just below the liver. It is attached to the main duct that carries bile from the liver into the intestine. The gallbladder temporarily stores bile, which is a liquid that contains a fat-digesting substance produced in the liver. During a meal, the gallbladder contracts, and bile moves from the gallbladder through small, tube-like passages (called the cystic duct and the common bile duct) into the small intestine. Here, bile mixes with food to help break down fats. Cholecystitis usually develops when a person has gallstones, which are rock-like deposits that form inside the gallbladder."

    "Chondromalacia Patella": [
        "The joints in your body are cushioned with a type of tissue called articular cartilage. This tough, rubbery tissue covers the ends of bones inside a joint. As the joint moves, the cartilage helps to cushion the bones and allows them to glide smoothly against one another. Sometimes, the cartilage inside a joint softens and breaks down. This condition is called chondromalacia. The cartilage loses its ability to protect the ends of the bones as the joint moves. The ends of the bones can rub together, causing pain."

    "Chondrosarcoma": [
        "Chondrosarcoma is a type of cancer closely related to bone cancer. However, chondrosarcoma forms in cartilage, the tough but flexible tissue that pads the ends of bones and lines joints, not in the bone tissue itself. This cancer usually develops in the cartilage that lines the bones of the pelvis, thigh, shoulder, ribs, or arm. However, one rare type of chondrosarcoma develops in the soft tissues, such as the muscles, nerves, or fat, of the arms and legs. The disease can also develop from an existing noncancerous (benign) tumor close to the bone. But in most cases, doctors don't know why it develops."

    "Chorionic Villus Sampling": [
        "Chorionic villi are small branching structures on one side of the placenta. They anchor the placenta to the wall of the uterus, almost like the roots of a plant. They have another root-like function, which is to absorb nutrients from the mother's blood in the lining of her uterus, and to deliver these to the umbilical cord. These structures contain cells from the developing fetus. A test that removes a sample of these cells through a needle is called chorionic villus sampling (CVS). CVS answers many of the same questions as amniocentesis about diseases that the baby might have. Diseases that can be diagnosed with CVS include Tay-Sachs, sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, thalassemia, and Down syndrome. (Rh incompatibility and neural tube defects, however, can be diagnosed only through amniocentesis.) CVS can be done earlier in pregnancy than amniocentesis and can be done when there is not enough amniotic fluid to allow amniocentesis. However, it has some extra risks when compared with amniocentesis."

    "Choroidal Melanoma": [
        "Choroidal melanoma is a cancer that affects part of the eye. It develops in the choroid, the sponge-like membrane at the back of the eye between the sclera (the white of the eye) and the retina. (The retina is the light-sensitive structure at the back of the eye. It sends visual information to the brain.) The choroid is rich in blood vessels and supplies nutrients to the retina. Over time, many choroidal melanomas enlarge and cause the retina to detach. This can lead to vision loss. The tumors also can spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body. The liver is the most common site for metastasis. If it spreads, this cancer can be fatal."

    "Chronic Laryngitis": [
        "Laryngitis is an inflammation of the larynx, the 'voice box' that contains the vocal cords in the upper portion of the neck. Laryngitis occurs in two forms, acute and chronic. Acute laryngitis typically is a brief illness producing hoarseness and a sore throat. In most cases, an upper respiratory tract infection causes it. Chronic laryngitis is a more persistent disorder that produces lingering hoarseness and other voice changes. It usually is painless and has no significant sign of infection. Among adults, the most common causes of chronic laryngitis are: Voice abuse or misuse — This means talking too much or too loudly. It can be an ongoing problem for people whose jobs depend on their voices, including singers, actors, telephone operators, lawyers, teachers, referees, coaches and anyone who must shout over loud noise at work (construction workers, personnel in airports and train stations, factory workers), Smoking — Cigarette smoke irritates the larynx, causing swelling and inflammation that thickens the vocal cords. This thickening can lower the pitch of the voice or make it sound raspy and harsh, Drinking alcohol heavily — Alcohol causes a chemical irritation of the larynx that produces changes similar to those seen in smokers, Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) — GERD is a disorder in which acidic fluids from the stomach flow backward (reflux) into the esophagus and throat, irritating the larynx, Work-related exposure to irritating chemicals or dusts — Many industrial products are suspected of causing chronic laryngitis and other respiratory problems. You can take these steps to help prevent chronic laryngitis: Don't smoke, Avoid secondhand smoke, Stay well hydrated to help keep your vocal cords moist, Avoid alcohol or drink in moderation, Use a humidifier to add moisture to the air in your home, Avoid long bouts of shouting or uninterrupted talking, Take protective measures to limit your exposure to irritating chemicals and dusts."

        "Chronic otitis media describes some long-term problems with the middle ear, such as a hole (perforation) in the eardrum that does not heal or a middle ear infection (otitis media) that doesn't improve or keeps returning. The middle ear is a small bony chamber with three tiny bones – the malleus, incus and stapes – covered by the eardrum (tympanic membrane). Sound is passed from the eardrum through the middle ear bones to the inner ear, where the nerve impulses for hearing are created. The middle ear is connected to the back of the nose and throat by the Eustachian tube, a narrow passage that helps to control the air flow and pressure inside the middle ear. The middle ear can become inflamed or infected when the Eustachian tube becomes blocked, for example, when someone has a cold or allergies. When fluid remains in the middle ear, the condition is called chronic serous otitis media."

    "Chronic Sinusitis": [
        "Chronic sinusitis is a long-term inflammation of the sinuses. The sinuses are moist air spaces behind the bones of the upper face — between the eyes and behind the forehead, nose and cheeks. Normally, the sinuses drain through small openings into the inside of the nose. Anything that obstructs that flow can cause a buildup of mucus, and sometimes pus, in the sinuses. Drainage from the sinuses can be obstructed by structural abnormalities of the nose, infection, or tissue swelling caused by allergies. The buildup of mucus leads to increased sinus pressure and facial pain. In adults, chronic sinusitis most often is linked to nasal swelling caused by allergies, especially allergies to inhaled dust, mold, pollen, or the spores of fungi. These allergies trigger the release of histamine and other chemicals that cause the inner lining of the nose to swell and block sinus drainage."

        "Cogan's syndrome is a rare, rheumatic disease characterized by inflammation of the ears and eyes. Cogan's syndrome can lead to vision difficulty, hearing loss and dizziness. The condition may also be associated with blood-vessel inflammation (called vasculitis) in other areas of the body that can cause major organ damage or, in a small number of cases, even death. It most commonly occurs in a person's 20s or 30s. The cause is not known. However, one theory is that it is an autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks tissue in the eye and ear."

    "Collarbone Fracture": [
        "When a bone breaks or cracks, the injury is called a fracture. In the collarbone (clavicle), fractures can happen in three separate areas: The outer third of the collarbone is near the tip of the shoulder. Fractures here usually are caused by an accidental fall or some other type of direct impact (football tackle, hockey check, car collision) that transmits force to the side or top of the shoulder. Fractures in this area account for about 15% of all collarbone fractures. About 80% of all collarbone fractures occur in the middle third of the bone. A fracture here usually is related to a fall on an outstretched arm. This area also can be fractured by a direct impact to the middle of the collarbone, especially during stick sports, such as hockey or lacrosse. The third nearest the breastbone rarely fractures. Fractures in this part of the collarbone almost always are caused by a direct blow to the front of the chest, often from a steering wheel impact during a car crash."

        "Colon polyps are growths of tissue inside the large intestine, also called the colon. Some polyps are mushroom-shaped protrusions on the end of a stalk. Others appear as bumps that lie flat against the intestinal wall. There are several types of polyps. Most are noncancerous (benign), but one type, the adenomatous polyp, is associated with changes (called mutations) in the DNA of the lining of the colon. These mutations can progress into colon cancer. The larger the polyp, the greater the chance that it contains cancerous cells."

    "Common Cold": [
        "The common cold, also called viral rhinitis, is one of the most common infectious diseases in humans. The infection is usually mild and improves without treatment. Because of the large number of people who get the common cold, this illness results in more than 22 million days of missed school and an even greater number of absent days from work every year in the United States. The average American has 1 to 3 colds per year. The common cold is an upper respiratory infection that is caused by several families of viruses. Within these virus families, more than 200 specific viruses that can cause the common cold have been identified. The virus family that causes the most colds is called rhinovirus. Rhinoviruses cause up to 40% of colds, and this virus family has at least 100 distinct virus types in its group. Other important upper respiratory virus families are named coronavirus, adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus. Since so many viruses can cause cold symptoms, development of a vaccine for the common cold has not been possible."

Although the normal frequency of bowel movements varies from person to person, about 95% of healthy adults have a pattern that ranges from three times a day to three times a week. In constipation, bowel movements either occur less often than expected or the stool is hard, dry and difficult to pass. Most of the time, constipation is not related to an illness or digestive disorder. Instead, the problem is caused by diet, lifestyle, medications or some other factor that hardens the stool or interferes with the stool's ability to pass comfortably."

Many natural and artificial chemicals can trigger contact dermatitis. These include ingredients found in: Antibiotic ointments, Cosmetics, Fabric finishes, Household cleaners, Industrial solvents, Laundry detergents, Metal jewelry, Perfumes, Shampoos, Soaps. Common skin exposure (contact) that can lead to contact dermatitis includes: Applying makeup or hair dye, Hand washing, Hiking near poison ivy, oak or sumac, Housecleaning, Shampooing hair, Sitting near a campfire where poison ivy is being burned, Spraying or dabbing on perfume, Wearing a diaper, Wearing a metal necklace or bracelet that contains nickel, Wearing clothes with metal snaps or zippers, Working with industrial solvents. Doctors classify contact dermatitis into two types: The type depends on the cause of inflammation: Irritant contact dermatitis. This is triggered by exposure to a chemical that is poisonous (toxic) or irritating to the skin. It is not an allergic reaction. Allergic contact dermatitis. This is an immune reaction. It occurs only in people who are naturally oversensitive to certain chemicals. In general, you can prevent contact dermatitis by avoiding exposure to irritating chemicals, plants, jewelry and in general, you can prevent contact dermatitis by avoiding exposure to irritating chemicals, plants, jewelry and other substances that trigger irritant or allergic contact dermatitis. To help prevent diaper dermatitis: Change baby diapers frequently, Clean the soiled area with warm water and a soft cloth, Avoid using store-bought wipes and cleansers on your child's skin. These products can trigger skin reactions. Apply a protective coat of zinc oxide ointment."

    "Corns and Calluses": [
        "Corns and calluses are a thickening of the outer layer of skin. This thickening is known medically as hyperkeratosis. Corns and calluses develop as part of the skin's normal defense against prolonged rubbing, pressure and other forms of local irritation. Corns — A corn is a protective thickening of the skin on a bony, knobby portion of a toe. At the center of a corn is often a very dense knot of skin called a core, which is located over the area of greatest friction or pressure. Calluses — A callus is a thickening of skin that is exposed to prolonged rubbing. Unlike a corn, the thickening in a callus is evenly distributed. There is no dense central core. On the soles of the feet, calluses typically develop near the base of the toes, where they are caused by friction from the inside of shoes. Less often, calluses are related to walking problems or foot abnormalities that place unusual stress on parts of the foot during walking."

    "Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease": [
        "Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare, fatal brain disorder caused by prions. Prions are normal proteins that have changed their shape. Healthy proteins have a healthy shape, which allows them to function normally.  The misshapen prion protein causes disease by making other proteins nearby change their healthy shape to the prion's unhealthy shape.  In this way one prion makes many more prions: it slowly turns healthy proteins into prions, too. When symptoms eventually appear, CJD causes rapidly progressive dementia (mental decline) and involuntary jerking muscle movements called myoclonus. About 90% of people with CJD die within 1 year of diagnosis. About 85-95% of cases of CJD are from sporadic mutations. Most cases of CJD cannot be prevented, but the disease fortunately is rare: only one person in one million develops the disease each year. Cases of CJD caused by medical procedures, or by eating infected animal meat, are even more rare. But they are preventable. Health care professionals minimize the risk by handling the fluids and tissues of patients with CJD with extreme caution, and by using special sterilization methods to disinfect equipment. Likewise, new precautions have been taken by the beef farming and beef processing industry. These precautions have helped to make the risk of infection from eating beef exceedingly small. Blood banks have put additional restrictions on blood donors. Blood banks in the United States now turn away blood donations from people who have lived in the United Kingdom for three months or longer from 1980 through 1996."

    "Crossed Eyes": [
        "Crossed eyes, also called strabismus, occurs when the eyes appear to be misaligned and point in different directions. Strabismus can occur at any age, but is most common in infants and young children. It can be seen in up to 5 percent of children, affecting boys and girls equally. Strabismus can occur part of the time (intermittent) or all of the time (constant). Intermittent strabismus may worsen when the eye muscles are tired — late in the day, for example, or during an illness. Parents may notice their infant's eyes wandering from time to time during the first few months of life, especially when the infant is tired. This occurs because the infant is still learning to focus his or her eyes and to move them together. Most babies outgrow this intermittent strabismus by the age of 3 months."

To help prevent viral infections that can cause croup: Wash your hands frequently, especially after you blow your nose. Also, wash your hands after you care for someone who has a cough, cold or sore throat, If someone in your household has a respiratory infection, keep his or her eating utensils and drinking glasses separate from those of other family members. Wash these glasses and utensils thoroughly in hot, soapy water, If a toddler with a respiratory infection has been chewing or sucking on toys, wash these toys with soap and water and then rinse them well, Promptly dispose of dirty tissues from runny noses and sneezes, Ask anyone with a cough or cold to avoid kissing or playing with your child."

As long as there is no pain or problem with sexual performance, men with a slightly curved penis should not be concerned. They do not need to see a doctor. However, some men develop a more serious bend in the penis. This bend interferes with sexual function or causes pain. This occasionally happens after the penis is injured. Injury may occur during intercourse or from a motor vehicle or industrial accident. Most cases, however, are the result of a poorly understood process known as Peyronie's disease. There is no way to prevent Peyronie's disease. However, middle-aged men who engage in more vigorous or frequent intercourse appear more likely to develop Peyronie's."

This mucus builds up, particularly in the lungs and organs of the digestive tract. Cystic fibrosis affects many parts of the body, including the lungs, liver, pancreas, urinary tract, reproductive organs and sweat glands. Certain cells in these organs normally make mucus and other watery secretions. But in cystic fibrosis, these cells produce secretions that are thicker than normal. This leads to other problems."

Although cysts can appear anywhere in the body, most frequently they live in the skin, ovaries, breasts or kidneys. Most cysts are not cancerous. Common locations of cysts include: Skin — Two types of cysts commonly occur underneath the skin, epidermoid cysts and sebaceous cysts. Both usually appear as flesh-colored or whitish-yellow smooth-surfaced lumps, Wrists — Ganglion cysts develop as rubbery or soft swellings, usually in response to a minor injury that triggers excess joint fluid to collect in a saclike structure next to the joint. Ganglion cysts also can occur on the fingers or feet, Knees — A Baker's cyst is a pouch of joint fluid that collects behind the bend of the knee. Because of its location, this cyst may cause the knee joint to feel swollen or tight. In most people, Baker's cysts are linked to arthritis or knee injury, Ovaries — An ovarian follicle that doesn't release its egg may form a cyst on the ovary. These cysts are not harmful and usually disappear after two to three months, Breasts — Breast lumps may be either cystic or solid. Breast cysts are almost always benign (non-cancerous), SymptomsVagina — Bartholin's gland cysts may develop in one of the Bartholin's glands, which lie just inside the vaginal canal and produce a protective, lubricating fluid, Cervix — Nabothian cysts develop when one of the mucous glands of the cervix becomes obstructed, Kidneys — Solitary cysts (also known as simple cysts) are the most common type. They appear as fluid-filled pouches and usually do not cause any symptoms. About 25% of Americans older than age 50 have this type of cyst. There is no way to prevent most cysts."

It occurs most commonly in scuba or deep-sea divers, although it also can occur during high-altitude or unpressurized air travel. However, decompression sickness is rare in pressurized aircraft, such as those used for commercial flights. When you scuba dive with compressed air, you take in extra oxygen and nitrogen. Your body uses the oxygen, but the nitrogen is dissolved into your blood, where it remains during your dive. As you swim back toward the surface after a deep dive, the water pressure around you decreases."

    "Detached Retina": [
        "The retina is the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye that converts light images into nerve impulses that are relayed to the brain to produce sight. When the retina separates from the deeper layers of the eyeball that normally support and nourish it, the retina is said to be detached. Without this nourishment and support, the retina does not function properly, and this can cause a variety of visual symptoms. For example, if the retina detaches near the macula, the part of the eye that is responsible for the center of the visual field (reading for instance), then there may be a sudden, significant blurring or loss of vision. However, if the area of detachment is closer to the outer edges of the retina, then the visual loss may be more like a curtain being drawn over one side of the visual field (the 'curtain effect'). Other symptoms of retinal detachment may include floating shapes in the field of vision or brief flashes of light."

In developmental dysplasia of the hip, the top of the femur moves in and out of the socket either part way or all the way. When it moves all the way out of the socket, it is called a dislocation. This happens when the ligaments that hold the two bones together are very loose or because the cup-shaped socket is not deep enough."

The two most common are called type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. During digestion, food is broken down into its basic components. Carbohydrates are broken down into simple sugars, primarily glucose. Glucose is a critically important source of energy for the body's cells.

    "Diabetic Ketoacidosis": [
        "Diabetic ketoacidosis is a potentially fatal complication of diabetes that occurs when you have much less insulin than your body needs. This problem causes the blood to become acidic and the body to become dangerously dehydrated. Diabetic ketoacidosis can occur when diabetes is not treated adequately, or it can occur during times of serious sickness. To understand this illness, you need to understand the way your body powers itself with sugar and other fuels. Foods we eat are broken down by the body, and much of what we eat becomes glucose (a type of sugar), which enters the bloodstream. Insulin helps glucose to pass from the bloodstream into body cells, where it is used for energy. Insulin normally is made by the pancreas, but people with type 1 diabetes (insulin-dependent diabetes) don't produce enough insulin and must inject it daily."

    "Diabetic Nephropathy": [
        "Diabetic nephropathy is kidney disease that is a complication of diabetes. It can occur in people with type 2 diabetes, the diabetes type that is most common and is caused by resistance to insulin, or in people with type 1 diabetes, the type that more often begins at an early age and results from decreased insulin production. Diabetic nephropathy is caused by damage to the tiniest blood vessels. When small blood vessels begin to develop damage, both kidneys begin to leak proteins into the urine. As damage to the blood vessels continues, the kidneys gradually lose their ability to remove waste products from the blood. If you have diabetes with high blood pressure, microalbuminuria or blood test evidence of kidney disease, it is important for you to take a medication from the ACE inhibitor or ARB group. These medications slow the progression of kidney disease in people with diabetes, although kidney disease continues to develop gradually. These two medicine groups are closely related, so the drugs usually are not combined with each other. Reducing the amount of protein in your diet also may be helpful to slow progressing kidney disease. Once nephropathy reaches advanced stages, you may need dialysis to remove waste products from the blood. There are two types of dialysis, hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis."

        "Diarrhea is more frequent and more liquid bowel movements than normal. There are many causes. Diarrhea often is caused by an infection with bacteria, viruses or a parasite. Bacteria cause diarrhea either by invading the intestine or by producing a toxin that makes the intestine secrete more water. When the diarrhea is caused by food contaminated with bacteria or parasites, people often refer to this as food poisoning. When symptoms start, try to rest more and switch to a diet of clear liquids. Drink water, juice, bouillon and weak tea to avoid becoming dehydrated. Replace lost fluids and electrolytes with sports drinks. Avoid coffee or soft drinks that contain caffeine, since caffeine increases the loss of water and salt. If you have nausea in addition to diarrhea, take very small sips of fluid frequently and suck on ice chips."

        "In diverticulosis, small pouches develop and bulge out through weak spots in the walls of the colon, typically in the part of the colon called the sigmoid colon on the left side of the abdomen. These small, balloon-like pouches are called diverticula. The condition is more prevalent as people age. For example, it is estimated that half of people in the United States aged 60 to 80 have diverticulosis, but only one person in 10 develops it by age 40. It is equally common in women and men. People whose diets contain large amounts of fiber are less likely to develop diverticular disease. The recommended daily fiber intake is at least 20 grams per day, but a healthier goal is 35 grams of fiber daily, preferably from fruits, vegetables and grains. The only possible treatment for diverticulosis is to increase fiber in the diet. Fiber will not heal existing diverticula, but it may prevent more from forming. If you have symptoms of mild diverticulitis, your doctor may recommend a short period of observation without antibiotics. There are no specific dietary recommendations, but many doctors suggest a low fiber diet until symptoms resolve. If the diagnosis is uncertain, an abdominal CT scan is usually ordered. Depending on the results, your doctor can then decide if treatment at home with oral antibiotics vs. intravenous (IV) antibiotics either at home or in the hospital."

    "Dry Skin": [
        "Normal skin has a soft, supple texture because of its water content. For skin to feel soft, pliable and 'normal', its top layer must contain a minimum of 10% water — and ideally between 20% and 35%. To help protect the outer layer of skin from losing water, the skin's sebaceous glands produce an oily substance called sebum. Sebum is a complex mixture of fatty acids, sugars, waxes and other natural chemicals that form a protective barrier against water evaporation. If the skin doesn't have enough sebum, it loses water and feels dry. If environmental factors cause more water evaporation and overwhelm the ability of sebum to prevent water loss, the skin will shrivel and crack."

        "Pain in one or both ears can occur for many reasons, some not related to the ear at all. When the pain is caused by an ear problem, the most common reason is blockage of the passageway between the middle ear and the back of the throat. This passageway is called the Eustachian tube. The middle ear is the small, air-filled cavity just behind the paper-thin eardrum. Normally, air enters the middle ear through the Eustachian tube, equalizing the pressure between the middle ear and outer ear."

    "Edema": [
        "Edema is swelling of both legs from a buildup of extra fluid. Edema has many possible causes: Prolonged standing or sitting, especially in hot weather, can cause excess fluid to accumulate in the feet, ankles and lower legs, Tiny valves inside the veins of the legs can become weakened, causing a common problem called venous insufficiency. This problem makes it more difficult for the veins to pump blood back to the heart, and leads to varicose veins and buildup of fluid, Severe chronic (long-term) lung diseases, including emphysema and chronic bronchitis, increase pressure in the blood vessels that lead from the heart to the lungs. This pressure backs up in the heart. The higher pressure causes swelling in the legs and feet, Congestive heart failure, a condition in which the heart can no longer pump efficiently, causes fluid buildup in the lungs and other parts of the body. Swelling is often most visible in the feet and ankles, Pregnancy can cause edema in the legs as the uterus puts pressure on the vena cava, a major blood vessel that returns blood to the heart from the legs, Low protein levels in the blood caused by malnutrition, kidney and liver disease can cause edema. The proteins help to hold salt and water inside the blood vessels so fluid does not leak out into the tissues. The only way to prevent edema is to prevent the cause. Smoking is the main cause of chronic lung disease. Congestive heart failure most often is caused by coronary artery disease, high blood pressure or drinking too much alcohol. Treatment of edema focuses on correcting the cause of the fluid accumulation. A low-salt diet usually helps. You also should avoid drinking too much fluid. If you are not short of breath, elevate your legs above the level of your heart to keep swelling down. Your doctor might suggest that you take a low dose of a diuretic (water pill). For swollen ankles and feet caused by pregnancy, elevate your legs and avoid lying on your back to help improve blood flow and decrease swelling."

    "Emphysema": [
        "Emphysema is a respiratory disease. In this condition, millions of the lungs' tiny air sacs (alveoli) stretch out of shape or rupture. As these thin, fragile air sacs become damaged or destroyed, the lungs lose their natural elasticity. They become unable to empty easily. Emphysema is a progressive disease, which means it continues to get worse. As the condition progresses, the lungs lose their ability to absorb oxygen and release carbon dioxide. Breathing becomes more difficult. A person feels easily short of breath, like he or she is not getting enough air."

    "Encephalitis": [
        "Encephalitis means inflammation of the brain. This inflammation usually is triggered by a viral infection, although sometimes it can be caused by a bacterial infection of the brain, such as Lyme disease. In some cases, symptoms are caused by direct infection of the brain. In other cases, the brain inflammation is caused by the immune system's response to the brain infection. Even if the immune system attack succeeds in eliminating the infection, it may injure the brain in the process. This is called post-infectious encephalitis. Often, viruses that cause encephalitis also cause inflammation of the delicate tissues that cover the brain and spinal cord, which are called the meninges."

    "Encopresis in children": [
        "Encopresis is when a child who is toilet trained passes stool (bowel movements) into his or her underwear. To have encopresis, the child must be at least four years old, the age by which most children can control bowel movements. Encopresis is also called fecal incontinence. In most children, encopresis is related to chronic constipation. Constipation is when bowel movements don't occur often enough. Also, the stool is hard and dry. To help prevent encopresis caused by chronic constipation, you can: Increase the amount of fiber in your child's diet, by giving plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, Make sure your child drinks plenty of fluids—water is best—throughout the day, Have your child sit on the toilet for 10 to 15 minutes twice each day, at the same times every day. Your child also should go to the toilet 10 to 15 minutes after every meal, Keep your child active. Exercise helps to get the intestines (bowels) moving, so that stool passes through more easily and quickly, Encourage and praise your child for each successful 'clean' day without soiling. Never punish, shame or blame, Check with your doctor before you give your child enemas or rectal suppositories. Also avoid using laxatives daily unless this is part of your child's treatment plan. If your child has encopresis because of chronic constipation, treatment is a three-step process. It involves: Clearing the bowel of the large chunk of stool. This usually can be done with medications (laxatives) taken by mouth. Sometimes, enemas or rectal suppositories are needed, Preventing the return of constipation. For six months or more, the child may need to take a stool softener to allow bowel movements to pass more easily and comfortably. Examples of stool softeners are lactulose and mineral oil. It can take several weeks, or even months of regular emptying before the stretched bowel returns to its normal size and regains its normal muscle tone, Teaching normal bowel habits. The child will need to sit on the toilet for 10 to 15 minutes at regular times during the day, including after every meal. This will allow the bowel muscles to respond normally to the urge to pass stool."

    "End-Stage Renal Disease": [
        "End-stage renal disease is a condition in which the kidneys no longer function normally. 'Renal' describes anything having to do with the kidneys. Nearly everyone is born with two kidneys. They both need to fail for end-stage renal disease to develop. Kidneys eliminate poisons from the body, and keep a normal balance of fluid and certain minerals in the body. When the kidneys can no longer perform this function, a person becomes very ill and ultimately dies. You can take steps to reduce your risk of developing end-stage renal disease: If you have diabetes, control your blood sugar, Closely monitor and aggressively treat high blood pressure. High blood pressure further damages the kidneys in people with kidney disease, If you have kidney disease, avoid over the counter arthritis medicines. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can cause kidney damage, Talk with your doctor about medication to slow the progression of chronic kidney disease. Your doctor may recommend an SGLT2 inhibitor, such as canagliflozin (Invokana), dapagliflozin (Farxiga) and empagliflozin (Jardiance), Quitting smoking and lowering cholesterol levels may also help. The two treatments for end-stage renal disease are dialysis and kidney transplant."

Endocarditis occurs when infectious organisms, such as bacteria or fungi, enter the bloodstream and settle in the heart. In most cases, these organisms are streptococci ('strep'), staphylococci ('staph') or species of bacteria that normally live on body surfaces.

The inflammation can extend to surrounding tissues responsible for vision. Endophthalmitis is rare. In most cases, an infection triggers this inflammation. The infection can be caused by: Bacteria, Fungi, Viruses, Parasites. The most common symptoms are loss of vision and pain. Additional symptoms vary. If you have had cataract surgery, you can help to decrease your risk of infection. To do so, follow your doctor's instructions for eye care after your surgery. Also, see your doctor regularly for follow-up eye exams. To prevent endophthalmitis caused by eye trauma, use protective eyewear at work and during contact sports. Goggles, eye shields and helmets can help protect against industrial debris that can pierce or cut the eyes. Treatment depends on: What caused the endophthalmitis, The state of vision in the affected eye."

It produces fluid that combines with sperm to make semen. At birth, the prostate gland is tiny. When testosterone levels rise during puberty, the prostate grows rapidly, doubling in size by age 20. Growth slows down for the next two decades and the prostate usually does not cause problems for many years. Less than 10% of 30-year-old men have an enlarged prostate. When a man reaches his 40s, the prostate goes through a second growth spurt. Half of all men have an enlarged prostate by the time they reach age 60, and by age 85, 90% of men have an enlarged prostate."

    "Epidemic Pleurodynia": [
        "The lining around your lungs is called the pleura. Pleurodynia is a general term for pain from this lining — pain in the chest or upper abdomen when you breathe. Epidemic pleurodynia is an infection caused by one of several viruses. This type of infection can cause a similar type of pain as the pain that comes from the lining around the lungs. However, in epidemic pleurodynia, the pain comes from the muscles in the chest that join ribs together. The viruses that cause epidemic pleurodynia can spread very easily among young children, who tend to put toys or fingers into their mouth. In healthy people, pleurodynia is a harmless infection that goes away on its own within a few days. To treat the muscle pain, your doctor probably will recommend over-the-counter pain relievers. Aspirin should not be given to children with pleurodynia because of the risk of Reye's syndrome, a serious reaction causing brain and liver injury in children who take aspirin during certain viral illnesses."

    "Epiglottitis": [
        "The epiglottis is the flap of tissue located just above the windpipe (trachea) that directs the flow of air and food in the throat. When we breathe, the epiglottis moves to allow air into the lungs. When we eat, the epiglottis covers the top of the windpipe, so that food goes into the swallowing tube (esophagus), and not into the lungs. Epiglottitis can occur at any age. Until 1985, epiglottitis occurred most commonly in children aged 3 to 7, but with the development of a vaccine against Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), epiglottitis is now increasingly rare in vaccinated children. Epiglottitis needs to be treated in the hospital so the person's breathing can be monitored. If the person is having trouble breathing, he or she may need to have a breathing tube inserted in his or her throat. Antibiotics should be started immediately after breathing is stabilized and blood samples and throat swabs are taken. Antibiotics usually are given through an intravenous line (into a vein)."

Rings are bands of normal esophageal tissue that form constrictions around the inside of the esophagus. They occur in the lower esophagus. Webs, which arise in the upper esophagus, are thin layers of cells that grow across the inside of the esophagus. Either condition may make it difficult to swallow solid food. Experts aren't sure what causes esophageal rings and webs. The condition may be congenital (inherited) or may develop after birth. People with esophageal rings and webs commonly have reflux symptoms."

        "Esophageal varices are swollen veins in the lining of the lower esophagus near the stomach. Gastric varices are swollen veins in the lining of the stomach. Swollen veins in the esophagus or stomach resemble the varicose veins that some people have in their legs. Because the veins in the esophagus are so close to the surface of the esophagus, swollen veins in this location can rupture and cause dangerous bleeding. Esophageal varices almost always occur in people who have cirrhosis of the liver. Cirrhosis causes scarring of the liver, which slows the flow of blood through the liver."

    "Esophagitis": [
        "The esophagus is the muscular tube that carries food through the chest, from the mouth to the stomach. Normally you don't feel it except when you are swallowing. However, if the inside lining of your esophagus becomes inflamed, you may experience pain or problems with swallowing. This inflammation of the esophagus is called esophagitis. The most common cause of esophagitis, acid reflux, sometimes can be prevented by some very simple measures: Avoid heavy meals, especially within several hours of bedtime, Cut out cigarettes and alcohol, Avoid large amounts of caffeine, chocolate, peppermint and high-fat foods, Control your weight. Treatment depends on the cause of esophagitis. Acid reflux — Lifestyle changes help reduce reflux: Lose weight if necessary, Eat smaller meals, Don't lie down right after eating, Discover and avoid foods that cause symptoms. Pill esophagitis — Drinking a full glass of water after taking a pill can help. Usually, if esophagitis has occurred, it is necessary for you to stop the medicine at least temporarily while you heal. Infections — The choice of treatment depends upon the infectious agent causing the esophagitis. Eosinophilic esophagitis — Because eosinophilic esophagitis can be triggered by acid reflux, treatment usually includes lifestyle changes and proton pump inhibitors."

    "Essential Tremor": [
        "Tremor is the shaky movements of your hands, limbs, head or voice that you can't control. Sometimes tremor is a normal reaction to a situation such as fear, fatigue or anger. It also can be a side effect of too much caffeine, a medication, or withdrawal from a drug or medicine. When tremor occurs during activities and there is no emotional or chemical cause, it can be a sign of a neurological disease called essential tremor. Essential tremor is different than Parkinson's disease, another neurological illness. Essential tremor is most noticeable when your body is in action, such as when you are writing, typing or pouring a beverage. In contrast, the tremors of Parkinson's are more noticeable at rest. Many people with essential tremor do not require treatment.  However, if the tremor causes significant distress or disability, medications called beta-blockers are the most effective treatments. Examples include atenolol (Tenormin) and propranolol (Inderal)."

Only a small percentage of people with Ewing's sarcoma are older than 20. Nearly everyone with this cancer is white. Because Ewing's sarcoma typically develops in bones, it used to be considered a bone cancer. But it actually arises from a type of primitive nerve cell.

If this arch is flattened only when standing and returns when the foot is lifted off the ground, the condition is called flexible pes planus or flexible flatfoot. If the arch disappears in both foot positions — standing and elevated — the condition is called rigid pes planus or rigid flatfoot. Flexible flatfeet are considered normal in young children because babies are not born with a normal arch. The arch may not form fully until sometime between ages 7 and 10. Even in adulthood, 15% to 25% of people have flexible flatfeet."

        "A person with farsightedness, also called hyperopia, has difficulty seeing objects close to the eye. They can see distant objects well. In most cases, farsightedness is an inherited condition caused by an eye that is too short front to back. This reduces the distance between the cornea (the clear film that covers the front of the eye) and the retina (the light sensitive layer at the back of the eye). Because this distance is shorter, images tend to focus behind the retina, rather than on the retina."

These seizures usually happen at the beginning of an illness, soon after the fever first starts. Febrile seizures affect about 3-5 percent of children. They are most common between ages 6 months and 5 years. What is a seizure? The brain's nerve cells (neurons) communicate with each other by giving off tiny electric signals. When someone has a seizure (convulsion), the way the brain's nerve cells give off signals suddenly changes, causing different muscles in the body to twitch or jerk uncontrollably."

Under normal circumstances, stool enters the end portion of the large intestine, called the rectum, where it is temporarily stored until a bowel movement occurs. As the rectum fills with stool, the anal sphincter muscle (a circular muscle surrounding the anal canal) prevents feces from coming out of the rectum until it is time to have a deliberate (controlled) bowel movement. Various conditions can cause incontinence."

    "Fever": [
        "A fever is an increase in body temperature above the normal range. However, body temperature varies between people, with different levels of activity and at different times of the day. Medical textbooks differ in their definition of the highest normal body temperature. Fever generally can be defined as an early morning temperature higher than 99 degrees Fahrenheit or a temperature higher than 100 degrees Fahrenheit at any time of the day. A part of the brain called the hypothalamus acts as the body's thermostat. When all is well in the body, the hypothalamus is set at the normal body temperature. Fever develops when the hypothalamus is set to a higher-than-normal temperature. This resetting of the hypothalamus is usually caused by small molecules called pyrogens in the blood. Pyrogens can come from outside the body (external) or can be produced inside the body (internal). External pyrogens include toxins (poisons) produced by infectious viruses or bacteria. Doctors often advise adults with mild to moderate fevers below 102 degrees Fahrenheit to: Drink plenty of water and fruit juices to prevent dehydration (abnormally low levels of body water). Fluids help to cool your body and they replenish vital salts and minerals (electrolytes), which may be lost during vomiting or diarrhea, Eat light foods that are easy to digest, Get plenty of rest, Take ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin or others), acetaminophen (Tylenol) or aspirin according to label directions.

        "Fifth disease, also known as erythema infectiosum, is a common viral infection among school-aged children. It is caused by parvovirus B19, which spreads through direct contact with fluids or mucus from the nose or mouth of an infected person. Fifth disease causes a bright red 'slapped cheek' rash that doesn't appear until an infected person is no longer contagious. Fifth disease usually is a mild illness, and some people who are infected may never realize they have it. Fifth disease is spread in the droplets of coughs and sneezes, on dirty tissues, and on drinking glasses and eating utensils. It is difficult to avoid exposure to the illness, because fifth disease is most contagious three to 14 days before its characteristic rash appears. During this time, most infected people don't know that they are ill and capable of spreading their illness to others. Since fifth disease is a mild illness, it usually does not require treatment. Home care for a child whose rash itches may include oatmeal baths or other over-the-counter bath treatments. Adolescents with joint pain may be treated with over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol and others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin and others). Aspirin should never be given to children with fever or flu-like illness, including fifth disease, because of the risk of Reye's syndrome, a serious brain problem that develops in some children who have had certain viral illnesses and have been treated with aspirin."

In people with fragile X, a particular section of the DNA code — CGG — is 'fragile' and gets repeated an unusually large number of times, compared with the normal 5 to 50 times. As a result, the FMR1 gene is not expressed (turned on), and the body cannot produce FMR1 protein, which is related to nerve function."

Friction blisters usually occur on the feet, where tight or poor-fitting shoes can rub and irritate delicate toes and heels for long periods of time. This type of irritation causes minor damage to the skin and the tissue just beneath the skin, then fluid accumulates just beneath the outermost layer of skin. If the irritation is enough to damage small blood vessels, the blister also may contain blood, and is then called a blood blister."

    "Frostbite": [
        "Frostbite is the freezing of body tissues (skin, muscle, bone) in extreme cold. At or below 59 degrees Fahrenheit, blood vessels close to the skin start to narrow (constrict). This helps to preserve your core body temperature. In extreme cold or when the body is exposed to cold for long periods, this protective strategy can reduce blood flow in some areas of your body to dangerously low levels. The combination of cold temperature and poor blood flow can cause tissue injury. Frostbite is most likely to happen in body parts farthest from the heart, and those with a lot of surface area exposed to cold. These areas include the toes, fingers, ears and nose. Body tissue will not freeze until the outside temperature is at or below 28 degrees Fahrenheit. If areas of tissue exposed to extreme cold begin to freeze, ice crystals form in some cells and fluid flows into these cells. The easiest way to prevent frostbite is to avoid exposure to cold. To treat frostnip or mild frostbite, gently blow air on the area or place it against a warmer area of the body. For example, place your fingers in your armpit or your palms against your ears, or place your fingers between someone else's hands. If you experience serious frostbite, see a doctor or go to an emergency room as soon as you can. If this is not possible, begin to warm the body part before visiting a doctor. However, it's best to warm frostbitten areas under medical supervision to minimize tissue damage. Also, because the frostbitten area can be painful as it thaws, a doctor's office or hospital can give you pain medicines to reduce the discomfort."

    "Gallstones": [
        "Gallstones are pebble-like nuisances that can form inside the gallbladder. The gallbladder is a pouch that collects bile as that liquid flows from the liver to the intestine through the bile ducts. Bile is a fluid that is made, in part, to help with digestion. The salts in bile make it easier for you to digest fat. Bile also contains some waste products including cholesterol and bilirubin (created when old red blood cells are destroyed). Gallstones form in the gallbladder when cholesterol or bilirubin particles begin to cluster together into a solid lump. The stone grows in size as the bile fluid washes over it, much like a pearl forms inside an oyster."

        "Flatulence is the passage of intestinal gas (flatus) through the rectum. Passing gas is normal, and every human being does it at least 14 times a day, consciously or unconsciously. Sometimes flatulence happens more often than expected, and this can become an embarrassing problem. Extreme flatulence can even interfere with a person's ability to work and socialize comfortably with other people. Most cases of flatulence are related to factors that can be controlled. This is because intestinal gas usually comes from two sources — swallowed air or the work of intestinal bacteria on undigested food."

    "Gastroenteritis in adults": [
        "Gastroenteritis is an inflammation of the intestines that causes diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea, loss of appetite, and other symptoms of digestive upset. In adults, the two most common causes of gastroenteritis are viral and bacterial infections: Viral gastroenteritis — In otherwise healthy adults, viral infections of the digestive tract are often responsible for mild episodes of gastroenteritis. These viral infections include the Norwalk virus, rotaviruses, adenoviruses and other agents. Bacteria — Salmonella, shigella, Campylobacter jejuni, E. coli and many other types of bacteria can cause gastroenteritis. They can be spread by close contact with an infected person, or by drinking or eating infected food or water."

    "Gastroenteritis in children": [
        "Gastroenteritis is an inflammation of the stomach and intestines that causes diarrhea, vomiting, nausea and other symptoms of digestive upset. In the industrialized world, the most common causes of gastroenteritis in children are viruses, bacteria (food poisoning), and intestinal parasites. Viral gastroenteritis – In otherwise healthy children, viral infections of the digestive tract often are responsible for mild episodes of gastroenteritis. In the United States, the most common causes of viral gastroenteritis in children are Norwalk-like virus (norovirus), adenoviruses, enteroviruses (during summer months), astroviruses and rotaviruses. Bacterial gastroenteritis (food poisoning) – Food that hasn't been prepared or stored properly can grow bacteria on its surface, and these bacteria sometimes produce irritating chemicals called toxins. Intestinal parasites – Intestinal parasites can be spread to children on dirty hands, on the soiled surfaces of toys and bathroom fixtures, and in contaminated water or food."

    "Gastroesophageal Reflux": [
        "Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is commonly called heartburn. This digestive disorder most often causes a burning and sometimes squeezing sensation in the mid-chest. In GERD, acid and digestive enzymes from the stomach flow backwards into the esophagus, the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach. This backward flow of stomach juices is called 'reflux'. These caustic stomach juices inflame the lining of the esophagus. If GERD is not treated, it can permanently damage the esophagus. Treatment for most people with GERD includes lifestyle changes as described above and medication. If symptoms persist, surgery or endoscopy treatments are other options."

    "Gastrointestinal Amebiasis": [
        "Gastrointestinal amebiasis is an infection of the large intestine caused by microscopic one-celled parasites commonly known as amoebas (Entamoeba histolytica). Because these parasites live in the large intestine, they travel in the feces of infected people, and can contaminate water supplies in places where sanitation is poor. The parasite can contaminate fruits and vegetables grown in areas where human feces are used as fertilizer. They can be transferred on the dirty hands of infected people who don't wash their hands often or correctly."

    "Gaucher": [
        "Gaucher Disease (GD) is an inherited condition that can damage many different parts of the body. Damage occurs when a type of fat — glucocerebroside — builds up in certain organs in the body. Normally, we have an enzyme—glucocerebrosidase — that eliminates this bad fat. People with GD do not make enough of this enzyme. GD typically causes a large liver and spleen, anemia, low platelet count, lung disease, and sometimes brain disease."

    "Generalized Anxiety Disorder": [
        "In generalized anxiety disorder, a person has frequent or nearly constant, nagging feelings of worry or anxiety. These feelings are either unusually intense or out of proportion to the real troubles and dangers of the person's everyday life. The disorder is defined as persistent worry for more days than not, for at least several months. In some cases, a person with generalized anxiety disorder feels he or she has always been a worrier, even since childhood or adolescence. In other cases, the anxiety may be triggered by a crisis or a period of stress, such as a job loss, a family illness or the death of a relative. The crisis or stress may have ended, but an unexplained feeling of anxiety may last months or years. If you have generalized anxiety disorder, the most effective treatment is usually a combination of medications and psychotherapy. Research shows that using both has a more lasting positive effect than either one alone. Your doctor may also offer treatment for other conditions that may be making matters worse, such as a medical problem or depression. You may need to try more than one approach before you find the right one. Many different kinds of medications can relieve anxiety. Here are the most common categories prescribed: Antidepressants — Despite their name, many of these drugs are very effective for anxiety. They are used very commonly to treat generalized anxiety disorder, Benzodiazepines — These drugs affect a chemical messenger that works in the brain's fear response system. Examples of benzodiazepines are clonazepam (Klonopin), lorazepam (Ativan), diazepam (Valium) and alprazolam (Xanax), Buspirone (BuSpar) — Buspirone is an antianxiety drug that can be effective for generalized anxiety disorder. However, it is used much less frequently than the drugs listed above. Like antidepressants, it usually takes two to three weeks to begin working."

    "Generalized Seizures": [
        "Normally, the brain's nerve cells (neurons) communicate with one another by firing tiny electric signals that pass from cell to cell. The firing pattern of these electric signals reflects how busy the brain is. The location of these signals indicates what the brain is doing, such as thinking, seeing, feeling, hearing, controlling the movement of muscles, etc. A seizure occurs when the firing pattern of the brain's electric signals suddenly becomes very abnormal and unusually intense, either in an isolated area of the brain or throughout the brain."

        "Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted infection that can cause blisters and skin ulcers in the genital and anal area. It can be caused by either of two types of herpes simplex virus, HSV-1 or HSV-2. HSV-2 is the more common cause. HSV-1 more commonly causes sores on the face and mouth. HSV spreads from person to person through kissing and skin-to-skin contact, as well as through vaginal, oral or anal intercourse. An infected person often transmits the virus when skin blisters or ulcers are visible, but the virus also can be spread when there are no symptoms or skin sores at all. Herpes virus can be transmitted by people who don't know they are infected."

    "Genital Warts": [
        "Genital warts are warts that form on the skin of the genital area. They are caused by certain subtypes of the human papilloma virus (HPV), the same virus that causes warts on other areas of the body. Genital warts are spread through sexual intercourse, so they are classified as a sexually transmitted disease (STD), and can affect both men and women. Genital warts also are known as condyloma acuminata or venereal warts. They can develop anywhere near the vagina, cervix, genitals or rectum. Because genital warts can take six months to develop, you can have the infection without having any symptoms. Human papilloma virus also causes virtually all cases of cervical cancer worldwide."

    "Gestational Diabetes": [
        "Gestational diabetes is the appearance of higher-than-expected blood sugars during pregnancy. Once it occurs, it lasts throughout the remainder of the pregnancy. It affects up to 14 percent of all pregnant women in the United States. It is more common in African-American, Latino, Native American and Asian women compared with Caucasians. Like the other types of diabetes, gestational diabetes results when sugar (glucose) in the bloodstream can't be moved efficiently into body cells such as muscle cells that normally use sugar as a body fuel. The hormone insulin helps to move sugar from the bloodstream into the cells. In gestational diabetes, the body does not respond well to insulin, unless insulin can be produced or provided in larger amounts. In most women, the disorder goes away when the pregnancy ends, but women who have had gestational diabetes are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later."

Although the illness most often occurs in developing countries, giardiasis is also a common cause of waterborne illness in the United States. A person can remain infected with Giardia until the infection is diagnosed and treated. In developing areas of the world, it is common for more than 20% of a country's population to have ongoing Giardia infection. In the United States, only 1 or 2 out of every 10,000 people have Giardia in a typical year, but the infection is found in about 1 out of 3 people who have prolonged diarrhea symptoms if they have recently traveled to a developing country."

    "Glaucoma": [
        "Glaucoma is a common eye condition in which vision is lost because of damage to the optic nerve. The optic nerve carries information about vision from the eye to the brain. In most cases, the optic nerve is damaged when the pressure of fluid inside the front part of the eye rises. However, glaucoma-related eye damage can occur even when the fluid pressure is normal. In the most common form of glaucoma, called primary open angle glaucoma, fluid circulates freely in the eye and the pressure tends to rise slowly over time. Gradual loss of vision is usually the only symptom."

    "Graves' disease": [
        "Graves' disease is a disorder of the immune system that causes the thyroid gland to become overactive. It is an autoimmune disorder, which means the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own cells instead of protecting them from outside invaders. In Graves' disease, the body's immune system makes abnormal chemicals called immunoglobulins that stimulate the thyroid gland to make too much thyroid hormone. This overactive thyroid state is called hyperthyroidism. Doctors don't know what causes Graves' disease, but the fact that it tends to run in families indicates that the disease may have a genetic (inherited) component."

    "Graves' eye disease": [
        "Graves' eye disease, also called Graves' ophthalmopathy, is a problem that develops in people with an overactive thyroid caused by Graves' disease. Up to one-half of people with Graves' disease develop eye symptoms. Usually the eye symptoms are mild and easily treated. Eye problems result from the swelling of tissues, muscles and fat in the socket behind the eye. This swelling causes exophthalmos, an abnormal protrusion of the eye, commonly associated with Graves' disease. The eyelids and membranes may retract as they swell. This can lead to exposure and infection of the cornea. The cornea is the transparent, dome-shaped 'window' that lies directly over the eye's pupil and iris. Symptoms of Graves' eye disease include: Early symptoms — Feeling of irritation in the eyes, excessive tearing or dry eye, forward displacement of the eye, sensitivity to light and double vision, Late symptoms — Swelling of the eye, inability to move the eye, corneal ulceration, and, rarely, loss of vision. In mild cases, cool compresses, sunglasses and artificial tears provide relief. People with Graves' eye disease often are advised to sleep with their heads elevated to reduce eyelid swelling. If double vision is a continuing problem, glasses containing prisms may be prescribed or surgery on the muscles may be advised. If the thyroid gland is overactive, anti-thyroid medications, radiation or surgery are standard options but radiation is not usually a first choice since it may make the eye disease worse. A selenium supplement may help reduce swelling and decrease mild symptoms."

    "Guillain Barre Syndrome": [
        "Guillain-Barré syndrome is an uncommon disorder that causes damage to the peripheral nerves. These nerves send messages from the brain to the muscles, instructing the muscles to move. They also carry sensations such as pain from the body to the brain. The nerve damage often causes muscle weakness, often to the point of paralysis, and can cause problems with sensation, including pain, tingling, 'crawling skin' or a certain amount of numbness. Guillain-Barré syndrome can become a medical emergency if the weakness affects the chest muscles responsible for breathing."

    "Hair loss": [
        "Hair loss can range from mild hair thinning to total baldness. Hair can fall out for many different reasons. Medically, hair loss falls into several categories, including: Telogen effluvium — This common form of hair loss happens two to three months after a major body stress, such as a prolonged illness, major surgery or serious infection. It also can happen after a sudden change in hormone levels, especially in women after childbirth, Drug side effects — Hair loss can be a side effect of certain medications, including lithium, beta-blockers, warfarin, heparin, amphetamines and levodopa (Atamet, Larodopa, Sinemet), Symptom of a medical illness — Hair loss can be one of the symptoms of a medical illness, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), syphilis, a thyroid disorder (such as hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism), a sex-hormone imbalance or a serious nutritional problem, especially a deficiency of protein, iron, zinc or biotin, Tinea capitis (fungal infection of the scalp) — This form of patchy hair loss happens when certain types of fungi infect the scalp, Alopecia areata — This is an autoimmune disease that causes hair to fall out in one or more small patches. Hair loss resulting from telogen effluvium or drug side effects usually requires no treatment other than discontinuing the medication that is causing the problem. Limiting trauma or chemical exposure (such as use of a blow dryer, hair straightener, coloring or perms) may limit or stop hair loss. Hair loss from poor nutrition or medical illness usually stops with the adoption of a healthy diet and treatment of the underlying medical condition. Treatment of fungal scalp infection requires 6 to 12 weeks of oral medication, such as terbinafine (Lamisil) or itraconazole (Sporanox), with or without shampoos containing selenium sulfide (Selsun Blue, Head & Shoulders, others) or ketoconazole (Nizoral). Alopecia areata can be treated with a corticosteroid that is injected or applied to the skin. Other treatments for this condition include anthralin cream (Drithocreme, DrithoScalp, Psoriatec), minoxidil (Loniten, Rogain) or a combination of these therapies."

    "Hammertoe": [
        "The smallest four toes of each foot have three bony segments connected by two joints, just as the fingers do. Hammertoe is a deformity in which one or more of the small toes develops a bend at the joint between the first and second segments so that the tip of the toe turns downward, making it looks like a hammer or claw. The second toe is affected most often. Most hammertoes are caused by wearing ill-fitting, tight or high-heeled shoes over a long period of time. Treating hammertoe involves straightening the toe, making tendons in the toes flexible again, and preventing the problem from returning. Some simple treatments include: Splinting the toe to keep it straight and to stretch the tendons of the foot, Using over-the-counter pads, cushions or straps to decrease discomfort, Exercising the toes to relax the foot tendons (a session with a physical therapist may help you get started with foot exercises), Wearing shoes that fit properly and allow toes plenty of room to stretch out."

    "Hay fever": [
        "Hay fever, also known as seasonal allergic rhinitis, is an allergy-related inflammation of the nasal passages, throat and eye membrane (conjunctiva), caused by sensitivity to airborne pollens and molds. These airborne pollens come from various species of trees, grasses, weeds and other plants whose pollens are carried by the wind rather than by insects. Because different types of pollen trigger symptoms in different people, each person's specific hay fever 'season' is fairly predictable and is related to times when their allergy-triggering plant is in bloom. For example, for people who are allergic to tree pollens and who live in temperate North America, symptoms usually are worst from March through May, when trees are blossoming. June and July are peak months for people allergic to grasses, while people with ragweed allergies suffer the worst symptoms from mid-August through October. Since molds depend on damp, dark conditions, people who are allergic to molds tend to have the least predictable allergy season. They usually find that their symptoms are more related to warm, rainy weather. In the United States, this means summer and fall are peak times."

    "Head injury in adults": [
        "Trauma to the head can cause several types of head and brain injuries, also called traumatic brain injury (TBI). Problems from head injury include: Skull fracture — A skull fracture is a crack or break in one of the skull's bones. In some cases, the skull is dented inward so that fragments of shattered bone are pressed against the surface of the brain. This is called a depressed skull fracture. In most cases, a skull fracture causes a bruise (contusion) on the surface of the brain under the fracture, Epidural hematoma — This is a very serious form of bleeding that happens when one of the blood vessels under the skull is torn during an injury. Usually the skull is fractured as well. As the injured vessel bleeds, blood collects in the space between the skull and the dura, the outermost of the three membranes that cover the brain, Acute subdural hematoma — In this injury, a blood vessel tears, and blood collects between the dura and the surface of the brain. This can happen when the head is hit or when a sudden stop causes the head to move violently forward and back (whiplash), Chronic subdural hematoma — Unlike the acute form, this type of subdural hematoma usually develops gradually because the bleeding inside the skull is less dramatic, and the hematoma can accumulate in several small, separate episodes of bleeding, Intraparenchymal hemorrhages and contusions— 'Intraparenchymal' means 'in the tissue'. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage is pooling of blood that occurs within the brain tissue. A contusion is bruising in the brain—in a contusion, a bruise or an area of swelling can be seen on a CT scan but blood does not pool, Concussion — If there are any symptoms of confusion, memory impairment or loss of consciousness after traumatic brain injury, the injury is called a 'concussion'. Symptoms of a concussion can include not having memory of the minutes immediately before the injury, temporarily losing consciousness, or having vomiting, dizziness, coordination problems, confusion, ringing in the ears, sleepiness or seizures. To help prevent head injuries, try the following suggestions: If you drink alcohol, drink in moderation. Never drink and drive, Wear a seat belt or helmet, If you play sports, wear appropriate protective headgear, If your job involves working high above the ground, use approved safety equipment to prevent accidental falls. Never work in a high place if you feel dizzy or light-headed, have been drinking alcohol, or are taking medication that can make you dizzy or affect your balance, Get periodic vision checks. Poor vision can increase your risk of falls and other types of accidents. This is especially true if you are elderly or if you work in high places."

        "Hearing loss is a decrease in the ability to perceive sounds. It can be partial or total, sudden or gradual, temporary or permanent. It can affect one ear or both. In general, the risk of hearing loss increases with age. Sound enters the ear and strikes the eardrum. This causes the eardrum to vibrate. The eardrum's vibrations are amplified through the middle ear by three tiny bones. Inside the ear, the vibrations are transformed into nerve impulses. These nerve impulses travel to the brain, where they are interpreted as sounds."

    "Hearing loss in children": [
        "A child with hearing loss has trouble hearing sounds in the range of normal speech. Hearing loss can be present at birth or can develop later in life. Babies born with other serious medical problems are at higher risk for hearing loss. Most deaf children are born to hearing parents. But the condition can be inherited. Most newborns have a hearing test before leaving the birth hospital, thanks to newborn hearing screening programs which are mandatory in most states. Prior to the introduction of these programs, hearing loss was often is not detected until a child was 2, 3 or even 4 years old. The critical period for language development is from birth to age 3. The failure to identify and treat hearing loss by 6 months of age can have serious implications for a child's speech."

    "Heart attack": [
        "A heart attack occurs when one of the heart's coronary arteries is blocked suddenly or has extremely slow blood flow. A heart attack also is called a myocardial infarction. The usual cause of sudden blockage in a coronary artery is the formation of a blood clot (thrombus). The blood clot typically forms inside a coronary artery that already has been narrowed by atherosclerosis, a condition in which fatty deposits (plaques) build up along the inside walls of blood vessels. You can lower your chances of having future health problems following a heart attack with these steps: Physical activity—Talk with your health care team about the things you do each day in your life and work. Your doctor may want you to limit work, travel, or sexual activity for some time after a heart attack. Lifestyle changes—Eating a healthier diet, increasing physical activity, quitting smoking, and managing stress—in addition to taking prescribed medicines—can help improve your heart health and quality of life. Cardiac rehabilitation—Cardiac rehabilitation is an important program for anyone recovering from a heart attack, heart failure, or other heart problem that required surgery or medical care. Cardiac rehab is a supervised program that includes: Physical activity, Education about healthy living, including healthy eating, taking medicine as prescribed, and ways to help you quit smoking, Counseling to find ways to relieve stress and improve mental health."

    "Heart Failure": [
        "Heart failure is a condition in which the heart cannot pump efficiently enough to meet the body's need for blood. Contrary to its name, heart failure does not mean the heart has failed completely. Heart failure is also called congestive heart failure. The inefficient pumping associated with heart failure causes a backup of blood in the veins leading to the heart. It causes the kidneys to retain fluid. As a result, the body's tissues swell."

    "Heart Murmur": [
        "A heart murmur is a sound made by turbulent blood flow within the heart. Your doctor hears this sound with a stethoscope. A murmur can occur in a normal heart. Or it may indicate some problem within the heart. Most often, the turbulence is normal. And the sound is called a benign flow murmur. It happens when blood flows faster through the heart, for example in a person who is anxious, has just finished exercising, has a high fever or has severe anemia. About 10% of adults and 30% of children (most between the ages of 3 and 7) have a harmless murmur produced by a normal heart. This type of murmur is also called an innocent murmur. Innocent heart murmurs do not need to be treated. Other types of murmurs that do not cause any symptoms also may not require any treatment, although your doctor should monitor them regularly. When treatment is required, it varies depending on the cause of the murmur: A tight or leaky heart valve – Depending on the type of abnormality, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and/or diuretics may be used to treat symptoms. Severe cases can be corrected surgically, often by replacing the diseased valve with an artificial one, Mitral valve prolapse – Most people with mitral prolapse don't have symptoms. Sometimes, people with palpitations are treated with beta-blockers (medications that reduce the heart's workload by slowing the heart rate and reducing the force of heart muscle contractions). In rare cases in which prolapse progresses to severe mitral regurgitation, the abnormal mitral valve will be repaired or replaced surgically, Congenital heart problems – Depending on the severity, congenital heart disease might need to be corrected surgically, Endocarditis – When endocarditis is caused by a bacterial infection, it usually is treated with several weeks of intravenous antibiotics. Sometimes, the infected heart valve must be replaced surgically, Cardiac myxoma – A cardiac myxoma is removed surgically."

    "Heart valve problems": [
        "The heart has four valves – the aortic, mitral, tricuspid and pulmonary valves. Like valves used in house plumbing, the heart valves open to allow fluid (blood) to be pumped forward, and they close to prevent fluid from flowing backward. Human heart valves are flaps of tissue called leaflets or cusps. Heart valve problems fall into two major categories: Stenosis – The opening of the valve is too narrow, and this interferes with the forward flow of blood, Regurgitation – The valve doesn't close properly. It leaks, sometimes causing a significant backflow of blood. Heart valve problems can be congenital, which means present at birth, or acquired after birth. A heart valve problem is classified as congenital when some factor during fetal development causes the valve to form abnormally."
    ],
    "Heart Valve Replacement": [
        "Sometimes a natural heart valve that is not working properly needs to be replaced surgically with a prosthetic valve. A prosthetic valve is a synthetic or tissue substitute for the natural valve. It is designed to mimic the natural valve's normal opening and closing motions. A prosthetic valve can replace any of the heart valves – mitral, aortic, pulmonary or tricuspid. Prosthetic heart valves are divided into two basic categories: synthetic mechanical valves and biological valves, which are usually made of animal tissue."

    "Heat stroke": [
        "The human body usually can regulate its temperature. When the body gets too hot, it uses several strategies to cool down, including sweating. But if a person spends too much time in the heat without taking in enough fluids, the body's cooling processes can't work properly. When the body becomes dehydrated, it can no longer cool itself by sweating. When this happens, body temperature can rise high enough to make the person sick. The first symptoms of heat illness occur as the body temperature climbs above normal, and can include headache, nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps and fatigue. These early symptoms sometimes are called heat exhaustion. If steps are not taken to reduce body temperature, heat exhaustion can worsen and become heat stroke."

Although heel pain sometimes is caused by a systemic (body-wide) illness, such as rheumatoid arthritis or gout, it usually is a local condition that affects only the foot. The most common local causes of heel pain include: Plantar fasciitis — Plantar fasciitis is a painful inflammation of the plantar fascia, a fibrous band of tissue on the sole of the foot that helps to support the arch, Heel spur — A heel spur is an abnormal growth of bone at the area where the plantar fascia attaches to the heel bone. It is caused by long-term strain on the plantar fascia and muscles of the foot, especially in obese people, runners or joggers, Calcaneal apophysitis — In this condition, the center of the heel bone becomes irritated as a result of a new shoe or increased athletic activity, Bursitis — Bursitis means inflammation of a bursa, a sac that lines many joints and allows tendons and muscles to move easily when the joint is moving, Pump bump — This condition, medically known as posterior calcaneal exostosis, is an abnormal bony growth at the back of the heel, Local bruises — Like other parts of the foot, the heel can be bumped and bruised accidentally, Achilles tendonitis — In most cases, Achilles tendonitis (inflammation of the Achilles tendon) is triggered by overuse, especially by excessive jumping during sports, Trapped nerve — Compression of a small nerve (a branch of the lateral plantar nerve) can cause pain, numbness or tingling in the heel area."

    "Hematuria": [
        "Hematuria is the presence of red blood cells in the urine. If there are enough red cells, the urine can become bright red, pink or cola colored. Often, however, the urine appears completely normal because there is not enough blood to cause a color change. In this case, the condition is called 'microscopic' hematuria. There are many possible causes of hematuria, including: Urinary tract infection — Hematuria can be caused by an infection in any part of the urinary tract, most commonly the bladder (cystitis) or the kidney (pyelonephritis), Kidney stones, Tumors in the kidney or bladder, Exercise — Exercise hematuria is a harmless condition that produces blood in the urine after strenuous exercise. It is more common in males than females, Trauma — Traumatic injury to any part of the urinary tract — from the kidneys to the urethral opening (the connection between the bladder and the outside world) — can cause hematuria, Drugs — Hematuria can be caused by medications, such as blood thinners, including heparin, warfarin (Coumadin) or aspirin-type medications, penicillins, sulfa-containing drugs and cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), Glomerulonephritis — Glomerulonephritis is a family of illnesses that are characterized by inflammation of the glomeruli, the filtering units of the kidneys, Bleeding disorders — This includes conditions such as hemophilia and von Willebrand's disease."

    "Hemophilia": [
        "Hemophilia is an inherited disorder. It prevents blood from clotting properly. People with hemophilia bleed longer than usual. This bleeding can range from mild to severe. In severe cases, people with hemophilia can bleed to death. People with a family history of hemophilia can learn their risks of passing hemophilia to their children. A simple blood test is usually all that is necessary. Sometimes excessive bleeding occurs despite the use of recombinant clotting factors. Hospital treatment is necessary when bleeding occurs. The situation is an emergency when it involves the brain, neck, the central nervous system or a vital organ. Hemophiliacs may require blood transfusions to treat excessive blood loss. Clotting factor concentrates help to replace the missing clotting factor in the blood. This can help to decrease how often and how severely you bleed. Clotting factor concentrates are given by injection into a vein."

    "Hemorrhagic Stroke": [
        "A hemorrhagic stroke is bleeding (hemorrhage) that suddenly interferes with the brain's function. This bleeding can occur either within the brain or between the brain and the skull. Hemorrhagic strokes account for about 20% of all strokes, and are divided into categories depending on the site and cause of the bleeding: Intracerebral hemorrhage — Bleeding occurs from a broken blood vessel within the brain. Some things that increase your risk for this kind of hemorrhage are high blood pressure (hypertension), heavy alcohol use, advanced age and the use of cocaine or amphetamines, Subarachnoid hemorrhage — Bleeding from a damaged blood vessel causes blood to accumulate at the surface of the brain. Blood fills a portion of the space between the brain and the skull, and it mixes with the cerebrospinal fluid that cushions the brain and spinal cord."

    "Hepatitis A": [
        "Hepatitis A is a viral infection that can inflame and temporarily damage the liver. Unlike other forms of hepatitis, hepatitis A rarely causes severe illness and does not lead to a persistent infection. Spread of the virus most often occurs from ingestion of contaminated food or water. It also can be passed during sexual practices that involve the anus. In rare cases, hepatitis A can be spread by contact with the blood of a person who has the infection, for instance, when intravenous drug users share needles. Many people have been exposed to hepatitis A. Symptoms can be very mild. So, you may not even be aware that you had the infection."

    "Hereditary-Patterned Baldness": [
        "Hereditary-pattern baldness is the most common cause of hair loss. Hereditary-pattern baldness is not really a disease, but a natural condition caused by some combination of genetics, hormone levels and the aging process. Almost all men and women will notice hair loss or hair thinning as they age. However, up to 40% of men and women will experience a more obvious form of this condition. Hair loss typically begins in the 20s and 30s, although in women the changes are most noticeable after menopause. The condition is also called androgenetic alopecia and, in men, male-pattern baldness."

A hernia occurs when part of an internal organ or body part protrudes into an area where it should not. The most common hernias occur in the abdominal area. A small portion of the intestine, or a piece of fat, pokes through a weak area in the muscular wall of the abdomen. This causes an abnormal bulge under the skin of the abdomen, usually near the groin or navel. There are many different types of hernias. The most common occurs when a portion of the intestine or a bit of fat pokes through a weak area in the muscular abdominal wall. This causes an abnormal bulge under the skin.

    "Hiatal Hernia": [
        "A hernia occurs when part of an internal organ or body part protrudes through an opening into an area where it shouldn't. A hiatal hernia is named for the hiatus, an opening in the diaphragm between your chest and your stomach. Normally, the esophagus (the tube that carries food to the stomach) goes through this opening. In a hiatal hernia, part of the stomach and/or the section where the stomach joins the esophagus (called the gastroesophageal junction) slips through the hiatus into the chest. There are two types of hiatal hernias: Sliding — A part of the stomach and the gastroesophageal junction slip into the chest. Sliding hiatal hernias are common, especially in smokers, overweight people and women older than 50, Paraesophageal — The gastroesophageal junction remains in its proper place, and a fold of the stomach slips into the chest, pinched between the gastroesophageal junction and the diaphragm."

    "High Blood Pressure":[
        "Blood pressure has two components: Systolic pressure is the top number. It represents the pressure the heart generates when it beats to pump blood to the rest of the body, Diastolic pressure is the bottom number. It refers to the pressure in the blood vessels between heartbeats. Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). So blood pressure would be expressed, for example, as 120/80 mm Hg. High blood pressure is diagnosed when one or both of these numbers is too high. High blood pressure is also called hypertension."

    "High Cholesterol":[
        "Cholesterol is a fatty substance that occurs naturally in the body. It performs several vital functions. It is needed to make the walls surrounding the body's cells and is the basic material that is converted to certain hormones. Your body makes all the cholesterol you need. You need only a small amount of fat in your diet to make enough cholesterol to stay healthy. The fat and cholesterol you eat are absorbed in the intestine and transported to the liver. The liver converts fat into cholesterol, and releases cholesterol into the bloodstream. There are two main types of cholesterol: low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (the 'bad' cholesterol) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (the 'good' cholesterol)."

    "Hip Fracture":[
        "The hip is the joint between the upper end of the thighbone (femur) and its socket in the pelvis. When a hip fractures (breaks), the injury is always in the femur. The upper end of the femur can fracture in any one of three places: The head of the femur — The rounded surface at the very end of the bone that fits into a socket in the pelvis, The neck of the femur — A somewhat horizontal stretch of bone at the top of the femur that gives this bone the shape of an inverted 'L', Between or below the greater and lesser trochanters — The femur naturally bends at the lower boundary of the hip, angling toward the knee. At this bend, two bony humps protrude along the outside edge of the femur. These ridges are the greater trochanter and lesser trochanter."

    "Hirsutism":[
        "Hirsutism is excessive hair growth in certain areas of a woman's face and body, such as the mustache and beard area, that creates a 'male pattern' of hair. Women normally can have fine, pale, faintly visible hair in these areas, but heavy hair growth in a male pattern with coarse or colored hair is not expected. Normal patterns of hair growth and hair distribution vary widely, determined mostly by racial background. For example, whites as a group have more facial and non-scalp hair growth than do blacks or Asians, and white women of Mediterranean heritage normally have more hair growth than do women from Nordic countries."

    "HIV/AIDS":[
        "The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) weakens the body's immune defenses by destroying CD4 (T-cell) lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. T-cells normally help guard the body against attacks by bacteria, viruses and other germs. When HIV destroys CD4 cells, the body becomes vulnerable to many different types of infections. These infections are called 'opportunistic' because usually they only have the opportunity to invade the body when the immune defenses are weak. HIV infection also increases the risk of certain cancers, illnesses of the brain and nerves, body wasting, and death."

    "Hives":[
        "Hives, also called urticaria, are circumscribed swellings on the skin that often are itchy. Often they are pink or red, but they don't have to be. Hives happen when the cells in the skin called mast cells release histamine, a chemical that causes tiny blood vessels (capillaries) to leak fluid. When this leaking fluid accumulates in the skin, it forms the swellings that we recognize as hives. Hives can be triggered by physical factors such as heat, cold, exercise, sunlight, stress, sustained pressure on a skin area (such as from a belt or shoulder strap), a sudden increase in body temperature (from a fever or a hot bath or shower) or from an irritating chemical, cosmetic or soap applied to the skin."

    "Hot Flashes":[
        "A hot flash is a brief feeling of intense warmth and sweating. Hot flashes commonly occur in women around the time of menopause. Researchers do not know exactly what causes hot flashes. Current theories suggest hot flashes are due to a menopause-related drop in the body's level of female hormones called estrogens. This drop affects the hypothalamus, an area of the brain that regulates body temperature."

There are more than 150 different types of HPV, each with its own favorite skin surface to invade. Some cause the small, painless, rough-surfaced warts found on the fingers and face. Others cause the larger, more painful and flatter plantar warts that grow on the soles of the feet. More than 40 different types of HPV can infect the skin covering the sex organs, cervix and opening of the anus."

    "Hydrocephalus":[
        "Hydrocephalus, also known as 'water on the brain', is a condition in which there is extra cerebrospinal fluid around the brain and spinal cord. Cerebrospinal fluid acts as a cushion for the brain and spinal cord, supplies nutrients, and takes away waste products. Hydrocephalus can be present at birth (congenital) or can develop later (acquired). Congenital hydrocephalus is present at birth, although it may not be detected until later in life. It forms when the brain and surrounding structures develop abnormally. The exact cause is usually unknown, but contributing factors may include genetics and certain infections during pregnancy, Acquired hydrocephalus results from injuries or illnesses that occur at birth or later, including infections in the brain and spinal column (meningitis), bleeding (hemorrhage) of blood vessels in the brain, severe head injury, brain tumors or cysts. Hydrocephalus also can occur when there is no known injury or illness to cause it."

An aneurysm is a bulge in an artery, similar to the bulge that appears at a weak spot of a hose, where the water pressure pushes out to create a bubble. Like the hose bubble, the area of an artery where an aneurysm appears is weak and has the potential to burst. Aneurysms most frequently occur in the arteries that bring blood to the brain. Brain aneurysms are also known as intracranial aneurysms or berry aneurysms (because most of the time they look like little round berries). They occur in up to 6% of people. In general, most brain aneurysms are small, rarely cause symptoms and have a very low risk of rupture."

    "Hypoglycemia":[
        "Hypoglycemia is an abnormally low level of blood sugar (blood glucose). Because the brain depends on blood sugar as its primary source of energy, hypoglycemia interferes with the brain's ability to function properly. This can cause dizziness, headache, blurred vision, difficulty concentrating and other neurological symptoms. Hypoglycemia also triggers the release of body hormones, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine. Your brain relies on these hormones to raise blood sugar levels. The release of these hormones causes additional symptoms of tremor, sweating, rapid heartbeat, anxiety and hunger."

    "Hypoparathyroidism":[
        "Hypoparathyroidism is a rare disorder in which the body produces too little or no parathyroid hormone. This hormone, together with vitamin D and another hormone called calcitonin, regulates the amount of calcium in the blood. Hypoparathyroidism can result in an abnormally low level of calcium in the blood, called hypocalcemia. Parathyroid hormone is produced by the parathyroid glands, four small glands located behind the thyroid gland in the neck."

        "Ichthyosis is the term for severe, persistent problems with dry skin that almost always start in childhood or infancy. Ichthyosis can be genetic (inherited) or can develop later in life. In a large majority of people with the disease, the cause is related to one or more genetic mutations. Under normal circumstances, the body continuously renews its skin surface, building new skin cells and allowing older cells to be shed from the surface. Ichthyosis disrupts this balance either because too many replacement skin cells are produced or because the skin cells do not separate well from the skin surface when it is their time to drop off."

    "Illness Anxiety Disorder":[
        "Illness anxiety disorder is a persistent fear of having a grave medical illness. A person with this disorder pays excessive attention to health. He or she can become easily alarmed by anything that might be interpreted as a sign of illness, including normal sensations, bodily functions and mild symptoms. For them, such experiences may signal an illness with a grim outcome. For example, a person may fear that the normal sounds of digestion, sweating or a mark on the skin may be indicators of life-threatening disease. Terminology has changed for disorders of this type. The field has moved away from using the word “hypochondriasis,” because it is a demeaning term. The word “somatization” has been replaced by “somatic symptoms.” It seems like a small difference but the change acknowledges that the person’s physical (i.e., somatic) symptoms are real."

    "Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura":[
        "Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), also known by the shorter name Immune Thrombocytopenia (same abbreviation ITP), can be understood by looking at the three terms that make up its name: Immune indicates that the illness is caused by the immune system, which makes cells and antibodies that attack the person's own platelets — the parts of the blood that help the blood to clot, Thrombocytopenic means that the illness is related to low levels of thrombocytes, another name for platelets. Platelets are produced in the bone marrow (the central lining of the bones). The body needs adequate numbers of functioning platelets to allow blood to clot and to limit bleeding if you are cut or experience other types of trauma, Purpura means that the illness produces a red or purple rash that is caused by bleeding under the skin. This is only one manifestation of the disease. Treatment varies, depending on whether ITP is acute, persistent or chronic: Acute ITP — Because people with acute ITP often recover without treatment, doctors may not prescribe medications unless there is serious bleeding or the platelet count falls below 20,000. If this happens, the first choice of treatment may prednisone (a synthetic steroid sold under several brand names); gamma globulin or anti-Rho(D) immune globulin (WinRho) given intravenously (into a vein) may also be recommended, especially for children with ITP, Persistent or Chronic ITP — Chronic ITP is treated either when the platelet count falls below 30,000, or when there is bleeding; steroids (such as prednisone) is often the first choice of treatment."

ED is not the same as premature ejaculation. The major causes of ED include: Vascular (blood vessel) disease — Erections happen when blood collects in the shaft of the penis. Vascular disease can limit the amount of blood flowing to or staying in the penis. Both can result in problems with erections, Vascular disease is the most common medical cause of impotence, Nerve damage — Nerves must be working normally for a man to get and keep an erection. Nerves can be damaged by diabetes, multiple sclerosis, prostate surgery or damage to the spinal cord, Psychological factors — Psychological issues such as depression, anxiety, guilt or fear can sometimes cause sexual problems. At one time, these factors were thought to be the major cause of impotence. Doctors now know that physical factors cause impotence in most men with the problem. However, embarrassment or 'performance anxiety' can make a physical problem worse, Medications — Many medications cause problems with sexual function. These include drugs for high blood pressure, depression, heart disease and prostate cancer, Hormonal problems — Abnormal levels of certain hormones can interfere with erections and sex drive. Hormonal problems, such as a low testosterone level, are an uncommon cause of impotence. There are many effective treatments for impotence. The most popular is a class of drugs called phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors. These include sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra), tadalafil (Cialis) and avanafil (STENDRA). These drugs are taken in pill form. They work in most men. But they are less effective in men with neurological causes of impotence."

In some cases, it is caused by other viruses. Mononucleosis has been nicknamed the 'kissing disease'. This is because Epstein-Barr virus commonly is transmitted during kissing. However, sneezes and coughs also can transmit the virus. Once a person is infected with Epstein-Barr virus, the virus remains in that person's body for the rest of his life. Mononucleosis typically occurs when a person first is infected with Epstein-Barr virus. This disease is most contagious during its acute stage. This is when the affected person still has a fever. Someone with mononucleosis does not need to be kept isolated from others. However, many doctors recommend that the patient avoid kissing others while he or she is feeling ill. This helps to help prevent the spread of the infection. Most treatment focuses on making the person more comfortable. Recovery usually calls for getting plenty of rest and fluids and treating symptoms."

A groin (inguinal) hernia occurs when part of the intestine bulges through a weak spot in the abdominal wall at the inguinal canal. The inguinal canal is a passageway through the abdominal wall near the groin. Inguinal hernias are up to 10 times more common in men than in women. There are two types of inguinal hernias: Indirect inguinal hernia — This occurs when the internal opening of the inguinal canal, which usually closes around the time of birth, remains open. This allows a portion of the intestine to slip through the inguinal canal, Direct inguinal hernia — This occurs when a portion of the intestine protrudes through a weakness in the abdominal muscles along the wall of the inguinal canal. These are common in adults, but rarely occur in children."

The symptoms of interstitial cystitis are often similar to the symptoms of a urinary tract infection. However, in interstitial cystitis, there is no infection, and the symptoms do not respond to antibiotic treatment. The goal of treatment is to reduce symptoms. No one therapy is so successful that it should always be tried first. Often a person with interstitial cystitis needs to try several therapies before finding the right combination. The symptoms of interstitial cystitis may go away over time, but there is no therapy that cures the disorder."

In the body, iron is needed to form myoglobin, a protein in muscle cells, and it is essential for certain enzymes that drive the body's chemical reactions. In the bone marrow, iron is used to make hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying chemical inside the body's red blood cells. If iron levels fall too low, it causes iron deficiency anemia. When this happens, red blood cells become smaller than normal and contain less hemoglobin."

Although there are many causes of jock itch, this term has become synonymous with tinea cruris, a common fungal infection that affects the groin and inner thighs. Tinea is the name of the fungus; cruris comes from the Latin word for leg. Jock itch can develop when tight garments trap moisture and heat. This creates an environment in which fungi multiply and flourish. Athletes often get jock itch. It occurs more commonly in men, but can affect women as well. The jock itch fungus may cause a rash on the upper and inner thighs, the armpits, and the area just underneath the breasts Many people with tinea cruris also have athlete's foot. Athlete's foot is called tinea pedis. The healthier you are, the less likely you are to get a fungal infection.

Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) — The ACL and the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) bridge the inside of the knee joint, forming an 'X' pattern that stabilizes the knee against front-to-back and back-to-front forces, Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) — The PCL works with the ACL to stabilize the knee. It most often sprains because of a direct impact to the front of the knee, such as hitting the knee on the dashboard in a car crash or landing hard on a bent knee during sports, Medial collateral ligament (MCL) — The MCL supports the knee along the inner side of the leg. Like the ACL, the MCL can be torn by a direct sideways blow to the outside of the knee or lower leg, the kind of blow that can happen in football, soccer, hockey and rugby, Lateral collateral ligament (LCL) — The LCL supports the outer side of the knee. It is the least likely knee ligament to be sprained because most LCL injuries are caused by a blow to the inside of the knee, and that area usually is shielded by the opposite leg."

    "Lactose intolerance":[
        "Lactose intolerance is a common cause of abdominal cramping, bloating and loose stools. This condition occurs when the body does not have enough of the intestinal enzyme lactase. The job of lactase is to break down lactose, the main sugar in milk. Once lactose is broken down into simpler forms of sugar, these simple sugars can be absorbed into the bloodstream. In normal digestion, lactose is digested in the small intestine without the release of gas bubbles. When lactose can't be digested well, it passes into the colon. Bacteria in the colon break down some of the lactose, producing hydrogen gas. The remaining lactose also draws water into the colon. The extra gas and water result in symptoms, such as cramping, diarrhea, bloating and flatulence (gas)."

    "Lacunar Stroke":[
        "Strokes can damage brain tissue in the outer part of the brain (the cortex) or deeper structures in the brain underneath the cortex. A stroke in a deep area of the brain (for example, a stroke in the thalamus, the basal ganglia or pons) is called a lacunar stroke. These deeper structures receive their blood flow through a unique set of arteries. Because of the characteristics of these arteries, lacunar strokes happen a little bit differently from other strokes. A lacunar stroke occurs when one of the arteries that provide blood to the brain's deep structures is blocked. These arteries are small, and are uniquely vulnerable. Unlike most arteries, which gradually taper to a smaller size, the small arteries of a lacunar stroke branch directly off of a large, high-pressure, heavily muscled main artery. High blood pressure (hypertension) can lead to lacunar strokes because it causes a pounding pulse."

    "Langerhans' cell histiocytosis":[
        "Langerhans' cells are white blood cells in the immune system that normally play an important role in protecting the body against viruses, bacteria and other invaders. They are found in the skin, lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow and lungs. In Langerhans' cell histiocytosis (formerly known as histiocytosis X), Langerhans' cells multiply abnormally. Instead of helping to protect the body, these cells, in massive numbers, cause tissue injury and destruction, especially in the bones, lungs and liver. Although this overgrowth of cells may be like cancer, most researchers do not consider Langerhans' cell histiocytosis to be a form of cancer."

    "Laryngitis":[
        "Laryngitis is an inflammation or infection of the voice box (larynx) and the vocal cords it contains. Laryngitis makes the vocal cords swell, changing the way they vibrate and the sound of the voice. Depending on the degree of swelling, the voice may become mildly hoarse, turn into a croak or whisper or even disappear temporarily. Viral laryngitis normally does not require medical treatment. Gargle with warm saltwater or use throat lozenges to relieve the sore throat. Breathing in moisturized air may help. You can use a humidifier or shut yourself in the bathroom for a few minutes after letting the shower run on its hottest temperature. To rest your vocal cords, talk as little as possible. Avoid whispering, too, because it strains the voice as much as normal speech."

    "Latex Allergy":[
        "A latex allergy is a hypersensitivity to latex, which is a natural substance made of the milky sap of the rubber tree. Latex allergies arise when the immune system, which normally guards the body against bacteria, viruses and toxins, also reacts to latex. In any type of allergy, when the immune system reacts against an otherwise harmless substance, the substance is called an allergen. When the immune system detects the allergen, a type of antibody named immunoglobulin E (IgE) is produced, triggering the release of chemicals within the body. One chemical is histamine. Histamine is partly responsible for the redness, itching and swelling that can occur in the skin during an allergic reaction, and it produces symptoms of hives, rashes, a runny nose, and watery, swollen eyes."

    "Lazy Eye":[
        "Lazy eye, also called amblyopia, is an eye problem that can occur in growing children. In the typical child with lazy eye, the right and left eyes have significantly different qualities of vision, so that the images produced by one eye are weak or distorted compared with the images produced by the other eye. Because the weak eye sends poorly focused images to the brain, the brain learns to depend on the stronger eye for its visual information. If this situation is not corrected, the brain eventually chooses to accept images from the stronger eye alone and ignores images from the weak one. In other words, the weak eye doesn't learn to see."

    "Leg fracture":[
        "Whenever a bone breaks or cracks, the injury is called a fracture. The leg has three bones that can fracture — the femur (the thighbone) and the tibia and fibula in the lower leg. When a fracture involves the knobby end portions of bones that are part of the hip, knee and ankle joints, the fracture is more complicated. This article describes only fractures of the straight shafts of the three long leg bones."

    "Leg strain":[
        "A muscle strain is a stretch or tear of muscle fibers. In the leg, muscle strains happen when a muscle is either stretched beyond its limits or forced into extreme contraction. Because the leg has many different muscles, it is vulnerable to several different types of muscle strains. Some of the more common ones are: Calf muscle strain (gastrocnemius strain). The calf muscle typically gets strained when the foot suddenly bends upward, stretching the calf muscle beyond its limits, Plantaris strain. The plantaris is a thin muscle that begins at the lower end of the femur (the large bone of the upper leg), stretches across the knee joint and attaches to the back of the heel along with the Achilles tendon, Hamstring strain (pulled hamstring). Hamstrings are long muscles that extend down the back of the thigh. Because hamstrings work to pull back the leg and bend the knee, they can be injured during running, kicking or jumping. You may feel a pop, usually at the back of the thigh, when the muscle tears, Quadriceps strain. The quadriceps is a large group of muscles in the front of the thigh that straighten out the knee, the opposite action from the hamstrings."

    "Leukemia":[
        "Leukemia is a form of cancer that affects the body's ability to make healthy blood cells. It starts in the bone marrow, the soft center of various bones. This is where new blood cells are made. Blood cells include: Red blood cells, which carry oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues and take carbon dioxide to the lungs to be exhaled, Platelets, which help blood clot, White blood cells, which help fight infections, viruses, and diseases."

    "Lupus":[
        "Lupus is thought to develop when your body's immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own tissues.  Immune proteins called autoantibodies attack many different parts of the body causing inflammation and tissue damage.  This may include the joints, skin, kidney, nervous system (brain, spinal cord and nerves), blood, heart, lungs, digestive system and eyes. Autoantibodies also can attach themselves to body chemicals, forming abnormal molecules called immune complexes that trigger additional inflammation and injury when they are deposited in various organs and tissues. The exact cause of lupus remains a mystery, although scientists are investigating many different possibilities and believe several factors may play a role in the development of the disease."

    "Lyme disease":[
        "Lyme disease is an infection caused by bacteria called Borrelia burgdorferi. These bacteria are transmitted through the bites of ticks, primarily the deer tick. Not everyone who develops symptoms of Lyme disease remembers getting bitten by a tick because the deer tick is very small and its bite can go unnoticed. If you are in a region where Lyme disease is more common, you can: Avoid woods, high brush, and grasses where ticks hide, Wear long pants and long sleeves; white clothing makes is easier to spot ticks, Examine your skin for ticks soon after returning from wooded areas or areas with high grass or brush, Apply tick repellents (especially those that contain DEET) to the skin and clothing. Some people with heart or neurological problems will be treated with antibiotics such as ceftriaxone (Rocephin) given intravenously (into a vein) for two to four weeks. Intravenous treatment also may be recommended if a person with Lyme arthritis does not respond to oral antibiotics. Doxycycline should be avoided in children less than 8 years old and for women who are pregnant or nursing."

    "Lymphedema":[
        "Lymphedema is the buildup of fluid called lymph in the tissues under your skin when something blocks its normal flow. This causes swelling, most commonly in an arm or leg. Lymph normally does an important job for your body. It carries foreign material and bacteria away from your skin and body tissues, and it circulates infection-fighting cells that are part of your immune system. The basic treatment for lymphedema includes: Elevating the affected limb, Doing exercises to help reduce swelling, Keeping the affected limb clean and dry and periodically applying lubricating lotions. Some ways to help decrease the risk of secondary lymphedema include: Avoid heavy lifting with the arm at risk, Elevate your arm or leg(s), Don't put use a heating pad on the arm or leg at risk, Avoid any constriction, such as a blood pressure cuff or tight clothing, Wear a compression stocking."

    "Major Depression":[
        "In major depression, the most prominent symptom is a severe and persistent low mood, profound sadness, or a sense of despair. The mood can sometimes appear as irritability. Or the person suffering major depression may not be able to enjoy activities that are usually enjoyable. Major depression is more than just a passing blue mood, a 'bad day' or temporary sadness. The symptoms of major depression are defined as lasting at least two weeks but usually they go on much longer — months or even years. The most helpful treatment is a combination of psychotherapy and medication. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly prescribed first. They include fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), paroxetine (Paxil), citalopram (Celexa) and escitalopram (Lexapro). In general, they are fairly easy to take and relatively safe compared with previous generations of antidepressants. One of the more common side effects is decreased sexual pleasure and delayed orgasm."

    "Male infertility":[
        "Infertility is the inability to achieve a normal pregnancy. About one in seven couples in the United States is unable to conceive a child after trying regularly for one year. Some couples will have success in the second or third year of trying, but couples that cannot conceive after three years are very unlikely to ever succeed unless they seek medical assistance. Infertility in a couple may be caused by the male partner, the female partner or both. Studies suggest the male partner alone is infertile in about 20% of cases and that both partners have fertility problems about 30% of the time. Therefore, the male partner plays a role in about half of all couples that have difficulty conceiving a child."

    "Malignant Hyperthermia":[
        "Malignant hyperthermia is a severe reaction to a dose of anesthetics. The reaction is sometimes fatal. It is caused by a rare, inherited muscle abnormality. Infrequently, extreme exercise or heat stroke can trigger malignant hyperthermia in someone with the muscle abnormality. In people with the muscle abnormality, muscle cells have an abnormal protein on their surfaces. This abnormal protein does not affect muscle function until the muscles are exposed to a drug that can trigger a reaction."

Connective tissue is the tough, fibrous, elastic tissue that connects one part of the body with another. It is a major part of tendons, ligaments, bones, cartilage and the walls of large blood vessels. In Marfan syndrome, the body can't produce normal fibrillin, an important building block of connective tissue. The problem in Marfan syndrome is caused by a mutation (change) in a gene. Genes are segments of DNA that direct the body to produce proteins. In many families with inherited Marfan syndrome, the mutation affects the FBN1 gene on chromosome 15, although other gene mutations may be involved in some cases."

    "Maturity onset diabetes of the young":[
        "Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) is an inherited form of diabetes mellitus. It is caused by a change in one of eleven genes. Up to 5% of all diabetes cases may be due to MODY. Just like other people with diabetes, people with MODY have trouble regulating their blood sugar levels. This disorder is more like type 1 diabetes than type 2, although it can be confused with either type. In type 1, the pancreas cannot make and release enough insulin. People with type 2 diabetes, on the other hand, usually make enough insulin, but their bodies cannot respond to it effectively (known as insulin resistance). Type 2 diabetes is usually associated with being overweight, but that is not true of type 1 diabetes or MODY. However, obesity does matter. An obese person with a MODY gene mutation may develop symptoms of diabetes sooner than someone of normal weight."

The pouch, or diverticulum, seems to be leftover tissue from the development of the digestive system. This tissue normally is reabsorbed before birth. When it contains gastric (stomach) tissue, it is more likely to cause bleeding."

    "Medication allergy":[
        "A true allergic reaction to medication occurs when the immune system is activated in response to a drug.  The medication can be taken by mouth, injected into the body or rubbed on the skin.  The symptoms from an allergic reaction vary from a mild skin rash to sudden swelling of many body parts with life threatening fall in blood pressure. Most people with a drug allergy have been exposed to that drug or a similar drug before.  During the earlier exposure, immune cells formed antibodies against the drug.  Antibodies are proteins created by the immune system to battle foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. When a person is exposed to the drug again, the antibodies go into action, setting off the allergic response. The symptoms of drug allergy may happen immediately or after taking the drug for a week or more."

The number of cases of melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, is increasing faster than any other cancer. Doctors aren't completely sure why melanoma rates are soaring. It could be from spending too much time in the sun during outdoor activities. It could also be due to global changes, such as the depletion of the ozone, which absorbs many of the sun's harmful rays."

It typically occurs on the face, particularly the forehead, cheeks and above the upper lip. The dark patches often appear on both sides of the face in a nearly identical pattern. The darker-colored patches of skin can be any shade, from tan to deep brown. Rarely, these dark patches may appear on other sun-exposed areas of the body. Melasma occurs much more often in women than in men, and usually is associated with hormonal changes. That is why the dark patches develop often during pregnancy, or if a woman is taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or oral contraceptives. Melasma during pregnancy is relatively common. Sometimes it is called the 'mask of pregnancy' or 'chloasma'. The dark patches typically last until the pregnancy ends."

    "Miscarriage":[
        "A miscarriage is a loss of a pregnancy. The term is generally used when the loss occurs before 20 weeks of gestation. Other terms that are used for such losses include spontaneous abortion and early pregnancy failure. About 15% to 20% of known pregnancies end in a miscarriage. Most miscarriages happen before the pregnancy is 12 weeks along. In the first several weeks of a pregnancy, a miscarriage sometimes happens because a fertilized egg did not properly form a fetus. In many cases, the activity of the fetal heart stopped days or weeks before the symptoms of miscarriage began. If you have a missed or incomplete miscarriage early in pregnancy, there are three options for management. The first option involves what is often termed 'expectant management': watching carefully for problems but letting tissues pass on their own. If bleeding is heavy, pain severe, or expectant management is unappealing, you and your obstetrician/gynecologist (OB/GYN) may choose a procedure called a dilation and curettage (D & C) to gently stretch open your cervix and remove any remaining fetal tissue from your uterus."

    "Mitral Valve Prolapse":[
        "Mitral valve prolapse is a malfunction of the heart's mitral valve, the physical doorway between the heart's left atrium and left ventricle. Normally, the mitral valve closes when the ventricle's muscles contract, preventing blood from flowing back into the left atrium when the heart pumps blood to the rest of the body. In mitral valve prolapse, however, a slight deformity of the mitral valve prevents the valve from closing normally. This appears as an abnormal floppiness, or prolapse, of the valve. The result is that small amounts of blood leak back into the left atrium, with very little effect on the heart's overall ability to pump blood. If you have mitral valve prolapse but do not have any symptoms, then you will not need treatment."

    "Molar Pregnancy":[
        "After a sperm fertilizes an egg, new tissues develop that normally form the fetus and placenta. A molar pregnancy, also known as gestational trophoblastic disease, occurs when the tissue that was supposed to form the placenta grows abnormally and can form a tumor that can spread beyond the womb or uterus. In a 'complete mole', no normal fetal tissue forms. In a 'partial mole', incomplete fetal tissues develop alongside molar tissue. These two conditions are noncancerous (benign) and make up 80 percent of cases. Three malignant forms of gestational trophoblastic disease occur, including invasive molar pregnancy, choriocarcinoma and placental site trophoblastic tumors."

        "A Morton's neuroma is a benign (noncancerous) swelling along a nerve in the foot that carries sensations from the toes. The reason the nerve starts to swell is unknown. But once swelling begins, the nearby bones and ligaments put pressure on the nerve, causing more irritation and inflammation. This produces burning pain, numbness, tingling and other abnormal sensations in the toes. A Morton's neuroma also is called an interdigital neuroma, intermetatarsal neuroma or a forefoot neuroma. It is not always possible to prevent a Morton's neuroma. However, you probably can reduce your risk by wearing comfortable shoes that have low heels, plenty of toe space and good arch support. If your Morton's neuroma is painful, your doctor usually will begin treatment with conservative therapies, including: A switch to shoes with low heels, wide toes and good arch support, Padding techniques, including metatarsal pads or toe crest pads, Shoe inserts (orthotics) to help correct any mechanical imbalance in the foot, anti-inflammatory medication, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin and other brand names) or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn and other brand names), A local injection of anesthetic and corticosteroid medication into the affected area."

    "Muscle strain":[
        "A muscle strain is the stretching or tearing of muscle fibers. Most muscle strains happen for one of two reasons: either the muscle has been stretched beyond its limits or it has been forced to contract too strongly. In mild cases, only a few muscle fibers are stretched or torn, and the muscle remains intact and strong. In severe cases, however, the strained muscle may be torn and unable to function properly. To help simplify diagnosis and treatment, doctors often classify muscle strains into three grades, depending on the severity of muscle fiber damage: Grade I strain. In this mild strain, only a few muscle fibers are stretched or torn. Although the injured muscle is tender and painful, it has normal strength, Grade II strain. This is a moderate strain, with a greater number of injured fibers and more severe muscle pain and tenderness. There is also mild swelling, noticeable loss of strength and sometimes a bruise, Grade III strain. This strain tears the muscle all the way through, sometimes causing a 'pop' sensation as the muscle rips into two separate pieces or shears away from its tendon. Grade III strains are serious injuries that cause complete loss of muscle function, as well as considerable pain, swelling, tenderness and discoloration."

    "Nabothian Cysts":[
        "Nabothian cysts are cysts filled with mucus that look like tiny bumps on the surface of the cervix. They are usually 2 millimeters to 10 millimeters in diameter, and they contain mucus that ranges in color from pale yellow to amber. In most cases, nabothian cysts occur when new tissue regrows on the cervix after childbirth. This new tissue blocks the openings of the cervix's nabothian glands, trapping their mucous secretion in tiny pockets under the skin. Nabothian cysts are a normal finding on the cervix of women who have had children. They also are seen in menopausal women whose cervical skin has thinned with age. Less often, nabothian cysts are related to chronic cervicitis, a long-term infection of the cervix."

    "Nail Trauma":[
        "A fingernail or toenail can be injured by a blow to the nail or by closing the finger or toe in a door or drawer. This kind of trauma commonly results in blood under the nail, a condition called subungual hematoma. Nails also can be accidentally torn or split, or a splinter can get under the nail. Repeated trauma to toenails, caused by ill-fitting shoes, can lead to deformities in the nails. The deformities may resemble a fungal infection; nails can be thickened or discolored and can lift away from the nail bed, which causes cosmetic concerns. To help prevent nail trauma: Wear properly sized shoes. Many people wear shoes that are too small, which can lead to many foot problems, including toenail trauma, Keep your fingernails trimmed and do not bite your nails or cuticles. Treatment for a subungual hematoma is aimed at relieving pressure by draining the blood trapped under the nail. For a small hematoma, you can heat a needle or the end of a paper clip until it is red-hot. Using gentle pressure, the hot tip can penetrate the nail, creating a small hole through which blood can drain. The nail may remain discolored after the procedure."

    "Narcolepsy":[
        "Narcolepsy is a disorder that causes sudden episodes of deep sleep. These episodes can occur often and at inappropriate times, for example while a person is talking, eating or driving. Although sleep episodes can happen at any time, they may be more frequent during periods of inactivity or monotonous, repetitive activity. Narcolepsy usually appears between ages 15 and 30, but the condition can appear earlier or later. Once it appears, narcolepsy is present for life. Men and women are affected equally."

    "Nasal Polyps":[
        "A nasal polyp is a benign (noncancerous) tumor that grows from the lining of the nose or sinuses. These polyps usually occur in both the right and left nasal passages and obstruct the flow of air. They can make your nose feel stuffy, and can decrease your sense of smell. Not all growths in the nose are polyps. Nasal polyps may result from chronic (long-lasting) inflammation of the lining of the nose, although they often occur for no apparent reason. People with chronic hay fever (allergic rhinitis) are more likely than others to develop nasal polyps. In addition, nasal polyps commonly develop in children with cystic fibrosis."

    "Nausea":[
        "Nausea is a general term describing a queasy stomach, with or without the feeling that you are about to vomit. Almost everyone experiences nausea at some time, making it one of the most common problems in medicine. Nausea is not a disease, but a symptom of many different disorders. It is caused by problems in any one of three parts of the body, including: Abdominal and pelvic organs — Many different abdominal conditions can cause nausea. Common abdominal causes of nausea include inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) or pancreas (pancreatitis); a blocked or stretched intestine or stomach; gastroesophageal reflux (GERD); irritation of the stomach, intestinal lining, appendix or pelvic organs; inflammation of the kidney; and gallbladder problems. Brain and spinal fluid  —  Nausea is common with migraine headaches, head injury, brain tumors, stroke, bleeding into or around the brain and meningitis (inflammation or infection of the membranes covering the brain). Balance centers in the inner ear — Nausea can be related to vertigo, a dizzy sensation of spinning, moving or falling when you are not moving."

    "Nearsightedness":[
        "A person who is nearsighted has difficulty seeing objects in the distance, although he or she can see close objects well. Nearsightedness is also called myopia. In some cases, nearsightedness is an inherited condition caused by an abnormally long eye, as measured from front to back. Because there is a longer distance between the cornea (the clear 'window' that covers the front of the eye) and the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye), images tend to focus in front of the retina, rather than on the retina itself."

    "Nephrectomy":[
        "A nephrectomy is the surgical removal of a kidney, the organ that filters waste from the blood and produces urine. There are two kidneys, right and left. Each is about 4 inches to 5 inches long. They are located at the back of the abdomen, just below the diaphragm, behind the liver on the right, and the spleen on the left. A portion of each kidney is protected by the lowest one or two ribs and by the muscles that cover the back and side of the body. Depending on the reason for a nephrectomy, all or part of one kidney or both kidneys will be removed: Partial nephrectomy – Part of one kidney is removed, Simple nephrectomy – All of one kidney is removed, Radical nephrectomy – All of one kidney is removed together with the neighboring adrenal gland (the adrenaline-producing gland that sits on top of the kidney) and neighboring lymph nodes, Bilateral nephrectomy – Both kidneys are removed."

    "Neuroblastoma":[
        "Neuroblastoma is a cancer that starts in primitive nerve cells. It affects infants (younger than a year old) and children. It rarely occurs after age 10. On average, children with the disease are diagnosed between 1 and 2 years old. Neuroblastoma often starts in the nerves in the adrenal glands. People have two adrenal glands, one on top of each kidney. These glands produce hormones that help control heart rate, blood pressure, blood sugar, and the way the body reacts to stress. When a neuroblastoma starts in an adrenal gland, it usually grows into a large, firm mass that presses on other organs."
    ],
    "Nosebleed":[
        "The inside of the nose is covered with moist, delicate tissue (mucosa) that has a rich supply of blood vessels near the surface. When this tissue is injured, even from a minor nick or scratch, these blood vessels tend to bleed, sometimes heavily. Nosebleeds near the front of the nose, called anterior nosebleeds, are very common since this is the most accessible area to injury. The most frequent location is the nasal septum, the wall between the two sides of the nose. In most cases, this type of nosebleed is not serious. It usually can be stopped with some local pressure and a little patience."

    "Obesity":[
        "It is difficult to directly measure body fat. Body mass index (BMI) is a popular method of defining a healthy weight. BMI should be used as a guide, along with waist size, to help estimate the amount of body fat. BMI estimates a healthy weight based on your height. Because it considers height as well as weight, it is a more accurate guide than body weight alone."

    "Obsessive compulsive disorder":[
        "In obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), a person is troubled by intrusive, distressing thoughts (obsessions) and feels the pressure to carry out repetitive behaviors (compulsions). Neuroscientists believe that the brain pathways involved with judgment, planning and body movement are altered in OCD. Environmental influences, such as family relationships or stressful events, can trigger or worsen OCD symptoms. OCD affects up to 3% of people worldwide. A childhood onset form can start around 10 years of age, more commonly in boys than girls. Most of the remainder of people with OCD have their first symptoms before they turn 25 — in this group, women outnumber men. OCD symptoms don't usually develop after age 30. The two defining symptoms of OCD are obsessive thoughts and compulsive actions. The symptoms are bad enough to be time-consuming, cause functional impairment or be significantly distressing. The most effective treatment for OCD is to combine psychotherapy and medications. Your doctor may also offer treatment for any other conditions that may be contributing to the problem, such as a medical problem or depression. You may need to try more than one approach before you find the one that is right for you."

    "Onycholysis":[
        "Onycholysis is the separation of a fingernail or toenail from its pink nail bed. The separation occurs gradually and is painless. The most common cause of onycholysis is trauma. Even slight trauma can cause onycholysis when it happens repetitively — for example, the daily tapping of long fingernails on a keyboard or counter. Onycholysis also can be caused by manicure tools that are pushed beneath the nail to clear dirt or smooth the nail.  Too much moisture also can cause the problem. Some medical conditions can cause onycholysis, generally by changing the nail's shape or the contour of the soft tissue bed beneath it. In these situations, the nail cannot attach smoothly to the nail bed. Some preventive measures will make onycholysis less likely to occur: Cut nails to a comfortable length so that they will be less likely to endure repeated trauma from tapping in everyday use, Wear rubber gloves to avoid repetitive immersion in water. Nails expand after they are exposed to moisture and then shrink while drying, a cycle that can make them brittle. Keeping your nails dry also will help prevent fungal infections, Avoid frequent exposure to harsh chemicals, such as nail polish remover."

    "Optic Nerve Swelling":[
        "Papilledema is the swelling of the optic nerve as it enters the back of the eye due to raised intracranial pressure. Fluid surrounding the brain is constantly produced and reabsorbed, maintaining just enough intracranial pressure to help protect the brain if there is blunt head trauma. When you have a headache or unexplained nausea and vomiting, your doctor will look into your eye with an ophthalmoscope. This handheld instrument shines a bright light into your eye. Changes in the appearance of the optic nerve and the blood vessels that pass through it can be seen through the ophthalmoscope and might be related to the source of your symptoms. The choice of treatment of papilledema depends upon its cause. If a brain tumor is diagnosed, a biopsy (by surgery) may be required as the first step to treatment. Brain tumors sometimes can be treated with a form of laser treatment or radiation and often require surgery. High blood pressure should be managed as an emergency in the hospital if it results in papilledema."

    "Osgood schlatter":[
        "Osgood-Schlatter disease is a common, temporary condition that causes knee pain in older children and teenagers, especially those who play sports and apply excessive stress to the patellar tendon (which connects the lower end of the knee cap to the upper part of the lower leg). During activities that include a lot of jumping and bending — hockey, basketball, volleyball, soccer, skating, gymnastics, or ballet — the quadriceps muscle (thigh muscle) pulls tightly against the kneecap and the kneecap's anchor, the patellar tendon. The fibers of the patellar tendon are attached to the shinbone (tibia)."

    "Osteoarthritis":[
        "Inside a joint, a tissue called cartilage cushions the joint and prevents the bones from rubbing against each other. Osteoarthritis occurs when the cartilage of a joint erodes (breaks down). Bones begin to rub against each other, causing pain and difficulty moving the joint. Osteoarthritis also can affect nearby bones, which can become enlarged in places. These enlargements are called bone spurs or osteophytes. Although the term arthritis means joint inflammation, there is relatively little inflammation in the joints of most people with osteoarthritis."

    "Osteoporosis":[
        "Osteoporosis is a bone disorder. The bones become thinner. They lose some of their strength and are more likely to break. People with osteoporosis have a higher risk of fractures. Bones can fracture even during everyday movements, such as bending or coughing. The most common osteoporotic fractures occur in the wrist, hip and spine."

    "Osteosarcoma":[
        "Osteosarcoma is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in bone. Although it is the most common type of bone cancer, it is rare. Osteosarcoma typically appears as a mass of abnormal bone in an arm or leg, usually near the knee or shoulder. Less often, the tumor develops in the pelvic bones, jaw, or ribs. It rarely develops in the fingers or toes. At the time of diagnosis, 10% to 20% of osteosarcomas have spread (metastasized) to another part of the body, usually the lungs."

    "Paget's Disease of Bone":[
        "Bones in your body continuously break down and form again in a natural and tightly balanced process called bone remodeling. This bone remodeling also occurs in response to stress or injury placed on the bone. For example, weight-bearing exercise leads to increased bone formation. In Paget's disease, more bone breaks down than usual and more new bone forms than usual. These changes in the bone can lead to bone enlargement and deformity."

    "Pain":[
        "You accidentally touch a hot stove. In a millisecond, you jerk your hand away. What just happened? You have pain receptors throughout your body, both outside and within. These receptors send electrical messages through your spinal cord to the brain. You only become aware of pain after your brain receives and interprets these electrical messages. In some cases, such as when you touch a hot stove, the body can spring into defensive action even before the brain knows what is happening. That's because pain messages that reach the spinal cord can cause an automatic reflex response, making muscles near the source of the pain contract to get away from the pain."

    "Painful sexual intercourse":[
        "Pain during or after sexual intercourse is known as dyspareunia. Although this problem can affect men, it is more common in women. Women with dyspareunia may have pain in the vagina, clitoris or labia. There are numerous causes of dyspareunia, many of which are treatable. Common causes include the following: Vaginal dryness, Atrophic vaginitis, a common condition causing thinning of the vaginal lining in postmenopausal women, Side effects of drugs such as antihistamines and tamoxifen (Nolvadex and other brands), An allergic reaction to clothing, spermicides or douches, Endometriosis, an often painful condition in which tissue from the uterine lining migrates and grows abnormally inside the pelvis, Inflammation of the area surrounding the vaginal opening, called vulvar vestibulitis, Skin diseases, such as lichen planus and lichen sclerosus, affecting the vaginal area, Urinary tract infections, vaginal yeast infections, or sexually transmitted diseases, Psychological trauma, often stemming from a past history of sexual abuse or trauma."

    "Panic Disorders":[
        "Panic disorder is a type of anxiety disorder. A person with panic disorder has panic attacks. These are repeated, unexpected episodes of intense fear and anxiety accompanied by physical symptoms that are similar to the body's normal response to danger. If you are truly in danger (for example, if you are confronted by a criminal with a gun), your body readies itself for 'fight or flight'. Heart rate increases. Blood rushes to arm and leg muscles, causing a trembling or tingling sensation. You may sweat and become flushed. You become intensely fearful, aroused and very alert. For people having a panic attack, these changes occur even though there is no physical threat. At the height of a panic attack, there may be a frightening feeling that the environment has somehow become unreal or detached."

    "Paronychia":[
        "A paronychia is an infection of the skin that surrounds a toenail or fingernail. There are two different types of paronychia, acute and chronic: Acute paronychia — This usually appears as a sudden, very painful area of swelling, warmth and redness around a fingernail or toenail, usually after an injury to the area, Chronic paronychia — The condition is caused by inflammation that usually develops slowly, causing gradual swelling, tenderness and redness of the skin around the nails. It often affects several fingers on the same hand. An acute paronychia causes throbbing pain, redness, warmth and swelling in the skin around a nail. In some cases, a small collection of pus forms under the skin next to the nail, or underneath the nail itself. Often, only one nail is affected. The type of treatment depends on the type of paronychia: Acute paronychia — You can begin treating yourself by soaking the finger or toe in warm water. Do this for at least 15 minutes, two to four times a day. If your symptoms do not improve with this treatment, or if pus develops near the nail, call your doctor, Chronic paronychia — Since most cases of chronic paronychia are caused by inflammation with or without an allergic reaction, your doctor will likely recommend treatment with a topical corticosteroid ointment or cream with or without a topical antifungal agent."

    "Partial Seizures":[
        "Nerve cells in the brain pass signals among themselves using both electrical current and chemicals. In a seizure, the brain's electricity is not passed in an organized way from one cell to the next, but spreads over a cluster of cells or the whole brain all at once. When only a portion of the brain is involved, the seizures are called partial seizures or focal seizures. These seizures vary tremendously in their effects on the person's movement, sensation or behavior depending on which area of brain is involved."

It is the most common serious infection among young women, with approximately 1 million new cases diagnosed in the United States each year. It usually affects sexually active women during their childbearing years. About one in every seven women receives treatment for pelvic inflammatory disease at some point in her life. Pelvic inflammatory disease is the most common preventable cause of infertility in the United States. The infection can cause tissue inside the fallopian tubes to become scarred, which can damage the fallopian tubes or block them completely. The more often a woman gets this infection, the greater her risk of becoming infertile. The risk doubles with each bout of the disease."

An ulcer in the lining of the stomach is a gastric ulcer. An ulcer in the first part of the small intestine is a duodenal ulcer. You may help to prevent peptic ulcers by: Avoiding smoking, Avoiding excessive alcohol use, Limiting the use of NSAIDs for pain. For ulcers caused by H. pylori, treatment requires a combination of medications. The goals of treatment are to: Kill H. pylori bacteria in the body, Reduce the amount of acid in the stomach, Protect the lining of the stomach and intestines. Most patients are treated with 'triple therapy'. This requires taking two antibiotics and one acid-suppressing medication for one to two weeks. Your doctor will prescribe a specific regimen based on convenience, cost and any allergies you have."

    "Peritonsillar abscess":[
        "The peritonsillar space lies between each tonsil and the wall of the throat. An infection can cause a pus-filled swelling (abscess) to develop in this space. Peritonsillar abscesses, also called quinsy, usually occur as a complication of tonsillitis. They most often are caused by 'strep throat' bacteria (group A beta-hemolytic streptococci). If a peritonsillar abscess is not treated promptly, the infection can spread to the neck, roof of the mouth and lungs. The swelling can push the tonsil closest to it into the center of your throat and move the uvula (the flap of tissue hanging in the back of your throat) from the center toward the unaffected side of your throat. In severe cases, the swelling can make breathing difficult or can close your airway."

    "Phenylketonuria":[
        "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare genetic (inherited) disorder that can cause abnormal mental and physical development if not detected promptly and treated appropriately. Normally, when a person eats foods that contain protein, special chemicals called enzymes break down these proteins into amino acids. The amino acids are then broken down further by other enzymes. A person with PKU does not have enough of the specific enzyme that breaks down the amino acid phenylalanine. Therefore, any phenylalanine in the food someone eats cannot be digested properly and collects in the body."

    "Phimosis and Paraphimosis":[
        "In an uncircumcised male, the head of the penis is covered by a sheath of skin known as the foreskin. Phimosis is a condition in which the foreskin is tightly stretched around the head of the penis and cannot be pulled back freely. Phimosis can occur naturally. For example, in boys younger than age 4, it is normally hard to pull back the foreskin. However, in older boys and men, phimosis often is triggered by an infection under the foreskin (balanitis) or by other medical conditions such as diabetes. Phimosis is usually painless. However, a very tight foreskin may interfere with urination or sexual function. In addition, phimosis may make it difficult for a man to clean under the foreskin, which can make infection of the skin more likely. Phimosis may be prevented by good hygiene. This includes fully pulling back the foreskin, so you can clean under it during bathing. Paraphimosis can be prevented by carefully replacing the foreskin every time it is pulled back. If paraphimosis occurs, circumcision may be recommended to prevent it from happening again. Phimosis without any symptoms does not require treatment. This is especially true in children. If a boy does not outgrow phimosis or there are problems with urination or hygiene, treatment with certain medicated creams, such as hydrocortisone, may be effective."

    "Phobia":[
        "A phobia is a persistent, excessive, unrealistic fear of an object, person, animal, activity or situation. It is a type of anxiety disorder. A person with a phobia either tries to avoid the thing that triggers the fear, or endures it with great anxiety and distress. Some phobias are very specific and limited. For example, a person may fear only spiders (arachnophobia) or cats (ailurophobia). There are three major types of phobia: Specific phobia (simple phobia). With this most common form of phobia, people may fear specific animals (such as dogs, cats, spiders, snakes), people (such as clowns, dentists, doctors), environments (such as dark places, thunderstorms, high places) or situations (such as flying in a plane, riding on a train, being in a confined space), Social anxiety disorder (formerly called 'social phobia'). People with social anxiety disorder fear social situations where they may be humiliated, embarrassed or judged by others, Agoraphobia. Agoraphobia is a fear of being in public places where it would be difficult or embarrassing to make a sudden exit. A person with agoraphobia may avoid going to a movie or a concert, or traveling on a bus or a train. Treatment usually includes some combination of psychotherapy and medication depending on the type of phobia: Specific phobia. Cognitive-behavioral therapy can help, especially a procedure called either desensitization therapy or exposure therapy. This technique involves gradually increasing your exposure to the thing you fear, at your own pace, under controlled circumstances, Social anxiety disorder. If your social phobia centers on one particular performance (for example, giving a lecture or playing in a concert), your doctor may prescribe a medication called a beta-blocker such as propranolol (Inderal), Agoraphobia. The treatment for this disorder is similar to the treatment for panic disorder. Drug treatment includes SSRI antidepressants, and a variety of other types of antidepressants, such as mirtazapine (Remeron), venlafaxine (Effexor), clomipramine (Anafranil) and imipramine (Tofranil). Psychotherapy is also helpful, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy."

    "Pinkeye":[
        "Conjunctivitis, also called pinkeye, is an inflammation of the conjunctiva, the transparent membrane that lines the eyelids and covers the whites of the eyes. Conjunctivitis can be triggered by allergies, by contact with irritating chemicals, or by infections with either a virus or bacteria. Viral conjunctivitis often is caused by one of the adenoviruses, a family of viruses that usually causes colds (upper respiratory illnesses). In temperate climates, adenoviruses are most active during spring, early summer and mid-winter. Bacterial conjunctivitis can be caused by several different types of bacteria, including Haemophilus influenzae, pneumococci, staphylococci (staph) and streptococci (strep). Most bacterial infections spread through contact with hands that have been contaminated with the bacteria. Children born to mothers with gonorrhea or chlamydia also can develop conjunctivitis if their eyes are infected by contaminated secretions in the birth canal during vaginal delivery. Symptoms of conjunctivitis include: Red, watery eyes, Eye discomfort (feeling 'itchy' or 'scratchy'), A discharge from the eyes that may form crusts around the eyelashes."

    "Plague":[
        "Plague is caused by Yersinia pestis bacteria. It can be a life-threatening infection if not treated promptly. Plague has caused several major epidemics in Europe and Asia over the last 2,000 years. Plague has most famously been called 'the Black Death' because it can cause skin sores that form black scabs. A plague epidemic in the 14th century killed more than one-third of the population of Europe within a few years. In some cities, up to 75% of the population died within days, with fever and swollen skin sores. Worldwide, up to 3,000 cases of plague are reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) each year, mostly in Africa, Asia and South America. f you live, work or vacation in regions where plague affects local rodent populations, here are things you can do to help prevent getting the infection and allowing plague to spread: Avoid contact with sick or dead animals, especially rodents. Report any observations of sick or dead animals to the local health department or law enforcement officials, Avoid contact with the nests and burrows of squirrels, chipmunks and other rodents, Eliminate sources of food and nesting places for rodents around homes, work places and recreation areas. Remove brush; rock piles; junk; cluttered firewood; and potential-food supplies, such as pet and wild animal food. Ask local health authorities how to rodent-proof your house, If you live in areas where rodent plague occurs, use veterinarian-approved flea collars and other flea repellents on cats and dogs. Treat pet dogs and cats for flea control regularly and not allow these animals to roam freely, If you anticipate being exposed to rodent fleas, apply an insect repellent containing DEET (diethyl toluamide) to your skin and use other insect repellents on clothing to prevent flea bites, Wear gloves when handling potentially infected animals or a dead animal. A person who is ill and is suspected of having the plague needs to be hospitalized. Hospital staff will take special steps to prevent the spread of the plague bacteria to other people."

    "Pleurisy and Pleural Effusion":[
        "Pleurisy means inflammation of the pleura, the membrane that lines the lungs within the chest cavity. Depending on its cause, pleurisy can be associated with an accumulation of fluid in the space between the lungs and chest wall (called a pleural effusion) or it can be dry pleurisy, which has no fluid accumulation. Pleurisy can develop many ways, including: Lung infection — In industrialized nations, bacterial pneumonia (lung infection) resulting from staphylococci, pneumococci, Haemophilus influenzae or other organisms is a frequent cause of pleurisy, Pulmonary embolism — A pulmonary embolism is a blood clot that has floated through the bloodstream and lodged in the lungs. In people with pulmonary embolism, symptoms of pleurisy tend to occur when the pulmonary embolism is fairly small and has lodged in a part of the lungs near the pleura, Lung cancer — Pleurisy can develop in people with lung cancer. When pleurisy occurs because of lung cancer, a bloody pleural effusion is common, Connective tissue disorders — Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus) and other connective tissue disorders can cause inflammation of the pleura, Rare causes — Radiation therapy (for cancer), a collapsed lung (pneumothorax) and pericarditis (as with severe kidney failure or following a heart attack) all can be accompanied by pleurisy, No identifiable cause — Pleurisy can develop for no clear reason despite extensive investigation. These cases are rare, and usually are presumed to be caused by a viral infection."

    "Pneumoconiosis":[
        "Pneumoconiosis is a lung condition that is caused by inhaling particles of mineral dust, usually while working in a high-risk, mineral-related industry. At first, irritating mineral dust can trigger lung inflammation, which causes areas of the lung to be temporarily damaged. Over time, these areas can progress to form tough, fibrous tissue deposits. This stage of pneumoconiosis is called fibrosis. Fibrosis stiffens the lungs and interferes with the lung's normal exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide."

    "Pneumonia":[
        "Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs. Almost all cases of pneumonia are caused by viral or bacterial infections. When pneumonia is first diagnosed, there often is no way to be sure if the infection is caused by a virus or bacteria. Therefore your doctor will need to treat it with antibiotics. Vaccination helps protect at risk people from S. pneumoniae infection. Currently, a 2 vaccine strategy is recommended. The two vaccines are PCV13 (Prevnar) and PPSV23 (Pneumovax) given several months apart. They are recommended for people 65 and older and for people ages 19 to 64 at higher than average risk of developing serious pneumonia. This includes people who smoke and people with: Lung disease including asthma, Heart disease, Liver disease, Kidney disease, A damaged spleen or no spleen, Certain types of cancer or undergoing cancer treatment, A weakened immune system. The main treatment for pneumonia is one or more antibiotics. A younger or healthier person can be treated safely with antibiotics at home and can feel better in a few days."

    "Pneumothorax":[
        "A pneumothorax is commonly known as a collapsed lung. Normally, the outer surface of the lung sits next to the inner surface of the chest wall. The lung and the chest wall are covered by thin membranes called pleura. A collapsed lung occurs when air escapes from the lungs or leaks through the chest wall and enters the space between the two membranes (pleural cavity). As air builds up, it causes the nearby lung to collapse."

    "Polio":[
        "Polio is a highly contagious infection caused by the poliovirus. Most people infected with the virus develop no symptoms from it.  However, in a small percentage of infected people, the virus attacks nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, particularly the nerve cells in the spinal cord that control muscles involved in voluntary movement such as walking. Permanent paralysis occurs in one out of every 200 cases of polio. Polio is also called poliomyelitis."

    "Polyarteritis Nodosa":[
        "Polyarteritis nodosa is a rare, but potentially life threatening, inflammation of the blood vessels (vasculitis) that damages the walls of the body's small- and medium-sized arteries. This damage slows the supply of blood and nourishment to the arteries, causing nearby tissue in many parts of the body to be injured or even destroyed."

    "Polychondritis":[
        "Polychondritis, also called relapsing polychondritis, is a rare disease in which cartilage in many areas of the body becomes inflamed. The disease most commonly affects the ears, nose and the airways of the lungs. The cause is not known, and it occurs most often in people in their 50s or 60s. A leading theory is that polychondritis is an autoimmune disease, in which the immune system attacks the body rather than foreign invaders such as viruses. Polychondritis is a systemic (body-wide) illness. Common symptoms include: Fatigue or malaise, Fever, Red, swollen, painful (inflamed) ears, hearing loss, dizziness, Ears that are 'floppy', that is, they are softer than normal, limp or droopy, Inflammation over the bridge of the nose, nasal congestion, Arthritis, Shortness of breath, cough, stridor (high-pitched sound during breathing), More rarely: eye inflammation, leaky heart valves, kidney disease, neurological problems, rash. Because the disease is so rare, studies to determine the single best treatment are difficult to do. As a result, there is no clear ideal therapy for this disease. Treatment depends on what parts of the body are affected and how severely."

    "Polycystic Kidney":[
        "Polycystic kidney disease causes numerous cysts (non-cancerous growths) to form in both kidneys. It is a genetic disease, meaning you inherit it from your parents. About 600,000 Americans have polycystic kidney disease. The kidneys are a pair of bean-shaped organs that sit in the upper part of the abdomen. They filter wastes and extra fluid from the blood, which get passed out of the body in the form of urine. The kidneys also regulate the amount of certain vital substances in the body, such as electrolytes."

    "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome":[
        "Estrogen and progesterone are the female hormones produced by the ovaries. The levels of these hormones vary during the monthly menstrual cycle. They are essential to the development of follicles, which are fluid-filled pockets, containing an egg that is released each month. A third hormone, testosterone, also is produced by the ovaries in small amounts. Testosterone is in a broad class of hormones called androgens, and it is the dominant sex hormone in men. Between 4% and 7% of women produce too much testosterone in their ovaries."

    "Post Polio Syndrome":[
        "Post-polio syndrome is an illness defined by a collection of symptoms that generally occur at least 10-20 years after infection with the polio virus. The hallmark of post-polio syndrome is new muscular weakness. This may present as weakness in the arms, legs, or trunk or difficulty with swallowing, talking or breathing if the muscles that control these functions are affected. Other symptoms of post-polio syndrome include muscle pain, fatigue and cold intolerance. Polio is a disease caused by an infection with the poliovirus. From the early 20th Century through the 1960's in the United States, epidemics of polio affected many people. The creation of polio vaccines has practically eliminated polio in the United States, and most of the developed nations of the world."

        "In post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), distressing symptoms occur after one or more frightening incidents. For the most part, a person with this disorder must have experienced the event him or herself, or witnessed the event in person. The person may also have learned about violence to a close loved one. The event must have involved serious physical injury or the threat of serious injury or death."

    "Posterior Cruciate Ligament":[
        "The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) are two tough bands of fibrous tissue that connect the thighbone (femur) and the large bone of the lower leg (tibia) at the knee joint. Together, the ACL and PCL bridge the inside of the knee joint, forming an 'X' pattern that stabilizes the knee against front-to-back and back-to-front forces. In particular, the PCL prevents the lower leg from slipping too far back in relation to the upper leg, especially when the knee is flexed (bent)."

    "Postpartum Depression":[
        "Postpartum refers to the period immediately after childbirth. When a woman has significant symptoms of depression during this period, she is said to have postpartum depression. Postpartum depression is not the same as the “baby blues,” a much more common condition that affects as many as 85% of new mothers. New moms often are emotionally sensitive and tend to cry easily. The baby blues is uncomfortable, but usually doesn't interfere with functioning as a mother, and it almost always goes away within a few weeks."

    "Pre-Diabetes":[
        "In pre-diabetes, blood sugar levels are slightly higher than normal, but still not as high as in diabetes. If diabetes is 'runaway blood sugar' think of pre-diabetes as blood sugar that is 'halfway out the door'. People almost always develop pre-diabetes before they get type 2 diabetes. The rise in blood sugar levels that is seen in pre-diabetes starts when the body begins to develop a problem called 'insulin resistance'. Insulin is an important hormone that helps you to process glucose (blood sugar). If usual amounts of insulin can't trigger the body to move glucose out of the bloodstream and into your cells, then you have insulin resistance. It surprises many people to learn that they may be able to prevent pre-diabetes and diabetes. To reduce your risk of both pre-diabetes and diabetes: Maintain an ideal body weight. Aim for a body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 25, Exercise regularly. Both aerobic and strengthening exercises can reduce blood sugar. You should exercise for a minimum of 30 minutes daily, Eat a balanced diet with just enough calories to maintain a healthy weight."

    "Preeclampsia and Eclampsia":[
        "Preeclampsia is a condition that begins during pregnancy, usually after the 20th week. However, the symptoms and signs of preeclampsia may persist after delivery, and rarely the condition might not be recognized until after the baby is born. A woman with preeclampsia develops high blood pressure and usually protein in her urine, and she often has swelling (edema) of the legs, hands, face, or entire body. When preeclampsia becomes severe, it can cause dangerous complications for the mother and the fetus. One of these complications is eclampsia, the term used when seizures develop in a woman with severe preeclampsia. Another concern is the higher risk of stroke during pregnancy and after delivery."

    "Premature ejaculation":[
        "Premature ejaculation occurs when a man reaches orgasm and ejaculates too quickly and without control. In other words, ejaculation occurs before a man wants it to happen. It may occur before or after beginning foreplay or intercourse. Some men experience a lot of personal distress because of this condition. As many as one in five men experience difficulty with uncontrolled or early ejaculation at some point in life. When premature ejaculation happens so frequently that it interferes with the sexual pleasure of a man or his partner, it becomes a medical problem."

    "Presbyopia":[
        "As we age, the lens of the eye becomes increasingly inflexible, making it harder to focus clearly on near objects. This is called presbyopia. No one knows exactly what causes the lens to become inflexible, but it happens to everyone as a natural part of aging. In order for us to see images clearly, light rays enter the eye, where the lens bends and focuses the rays on the retina. The lens changes shape to allow the eye to focus on objects at different distances. Beginning early in life — perhaps as early as age 10 — our lenses gradually stiffen and begin to lose the ability to change shape. By the time we are in our 40s, the lens has trouble focusing up close, and we begin to experience blurred vision when we try to do tasks that require up-close focus, such as reading or needlework."

    "Priapism":[
        "Priapism is an abnormally prolonged and often painful erection. This erection may not be related to sexual desire or stimulation. It often won't be relieved by orgasm. Priapism may start after prolonged sexual activity, although this by itself is not believed to cause priapism. Most men seek medical attention within hours to days, but a few people may have a partial erection that persists for weeks."

    "Pseudogout":[
        "Pseudogout is a form of arthritis triggered by deposits of calcium crystals (calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate) in the joints. It is also called calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD). This disease can cause short-term or long-term swelling in joints, most often the knee, wrist, shoulder, ankle, or elbow. As the name suggests, this condition can appear similar to gout, which is caused by another type of crystal - uric acid crystals - and commonly causes sudden pain and swelling in a single joint, usually in the foot. Pseudogout also can resemble osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis."

    "Pubic Lice or Crab Lice":[
        "Pubic lice or crab lice are tiny insects that infest a person's pubic hair, although they also can be found on facial hair, armpit hair and eyelashes. The insects look like crabs, and a person with these lice often is said to have 'crabs'. Their claws let them grasp hairs so they can both move around and remain on their human host. Crab lice, like all lice, feed only on their host's blood. Female lice produce eggs, which are cemented to the hair shaft close to the skin. It takes about 7 to 10 days for an egg to hatch. Crab lice usually cause intense itching, due mainly to an allergic reaction to the saliva of the louse. There also may be tiny red or blue marks where the insect has been biting, and the eggs, or nits, may be seen attached to the pubic hair close to the skin. Sometimes, more severe reactions occur, such as the development of pustules or intense skin reactions where the insects have been feeding."

    "Pyelonephritis":[
        "Pyelonephritis is a kidney infection usually caused by bacteria that have traveled to the kidney from an infection in the bladder. Women have more bladder infections (also called urinary tract infections) than men because the distance to the bladder from skin, where bacteria normally live, is quite short and direct. However, the infection usually remains in the bladder."

    "Rash":[
        "A rash is a temporary eruption or discoloration of the skin and is often inflamed or swollen. Rashes come in many forms and levels of severity, and they last for different amounts of time. Some common causes of rashes include: Infections: Viral infections, such as measles, rubella, roseola, fifth disease, varicella zoster, herpes or shingles, Bacterial infections, such as impetigo, scarlet fever or Lyme disease, Fungal infections, such as jock itch (a fungal infection in the groin region), Many others. Allergic reactions: Medications, including antibiotics, seizure medications and diuretics, Topical skin products, such as cosmetics, perfumes or skin creams, Foods, especially peanuts, seafood and eggs, Insect stings (including bees, wasps and hornets). Autoimmune disorders: This category includes systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus), dermatomyositis and scleroderma, disorders in which the body's immune defenses mistakenly attack healthy areas of the body, including the skin. Poisonous plants: Poison ivy, poison oak and poison sumac share a highly allergenic sap resin that can cause allergic rashes in 70% of people exposed to it. Treatment depends on the cause of the rash: Infections — Bacterial infections are treated with antibiotics. Fungal infections are treated with antifungal medications. Many viral infections that cause rash will go away within several days and require no medication. Less often, antiviral drugs are necessary, Allergic reactions — A severe allergic reaction is a life-threatening medical emergency. It must be treated immediately with epinephrine, a medication that opens narrowed airways and raises dangerously low blood pressure, Local irritants — Diaper rash is treated by changing diapers frequently and using nonprescription creams or ointments that contain zinc oxide and mineral oil, Poisonous plants — The skin should be flushed thoroughly with warm water to remove the allergenic substance. Only then should you lather with soap and water, Autoimmune disorders — These illnesses are treated with corticosteroid and immunosuppressive drugs, medications that suppress the patient's overactive immune system."

Sometimes, an area of this wall gets weak, and part of the rectum bulges into the vagina. This bulge is called a rectocele. The problem usually develops after the wall is damaged during a vaginal delivery. The bulge may occur after a vaginal delivery, but symptoms may not develop until later in life. Rectoceles are more commonly seen in older women who have entered menopause."

    "Respiratory Syncytial Virus":[
        "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the many viruses that cause the common cold and infections in the upper parts of the respiratory tract. RSV also can cause infection in the lower respiratory tract, such as pneumonia in the lung tissue and bronchiolitis inside the smallest airways (bronchioles) in the lungs. RSV tends to cause typical cold symptoms, including: Sore throat, Runny nose, Stuffy nose, Cough, Wheezing, Headache, Fever. Preventing RSV is difficult because the virus is highly contagious and is spread easily from person to person. The best way to prevent RSV infection is to wash hands regularly, especially when someone in the family has cold symptoms. For mild RSV infections, treatment is aimed at making the person comfortable. Treatment may include: Something for fever and pain -- for example, acetaminophen (Tylenol and others) or ibuprofen (Advil and others), Drinking lots of fluids to prevent dehydration, Bed rest, A humidifier to soothe the throat and nose and possibly relieve cough, Saline (salt water) nose drops, A bulb syringe to gently loosen mucus blocking a child's or infant's nose."

    "Retinal Vessel Occlusion":[
        "The retina is the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye that is responsible for vision. Blood circulation to most of the retina's surface is primarily through one artery and one vein. If either blood vessel or one of their smaller branches is blocked, blood circulation to the retina can be significantly disrupted. The blockage is called an occlusion. If a main vessel becomes occluded, the eye typically loses vision, often suddenly. If blockage occurs in a smaller branch vessel, there may be partial vision loss or no symptoms. The condition is often painless."

    "Retinitis Pigmentosa":[
        "Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an eye disease. It leads to gradual loss of vision and, sometimes, blindness. RP occurs when the light-sensing cells in the eye break down. These cells, called rods and cones, are located in the retina. This is the back portion of the eye that receives light coming into the eye, and sends that visual information to the brain."

    "Retrobulbar Neuritis":[
        "Retrobulbar neuritis is a form of optic neuritis in which the optic nerve, which is at the back of the eye, becomes inflamed. The inflamed area is between the back of the eye and the brain. The optic nerve contains fibers that carry visual information from the nerve cells in the retina to the nerve cells in the brain. When these fibers become inflamed, visual signaling to the brain becomes disrupted, and vision is impaired."

    "Retrograde Ejaculation":[
        "Ejaculation is the ejection of semen out of the urethra (passageway inside the penis) when a man has an orgasm. Under normal circumstances, ejaculation propels semen forward through a man's urethra and out the tip of his penis. This is because a tiny sphincter (circular muscle) at the entrance to the bladder shuts the opening to the bladder and prevents semen from entering. Retrograde ejaculation is when the semen travels backwards into the bladder. Most men who have retrograde ejaculation do not need specific treatment. If the condition is a side effect of medication, your doctor may be able to switch you to a different drug that does not cause the problem. In other men, all that is needed is reassurance that retrograde ejaculation is not a serious medical problem and that it is not a sign of a serious condition."

    "Rocky mountain spotted fever":[
        "Rocky Mountain spotted fever is a severe illness caused by tiny bacteria called Rickettsia rickettsii, which are transmitted through the bite of an infected tick. In the eastern United States and in California, the infected tick is usually Dermacentor variabilis, the American dog tick. In most of the western United States, the tick is more likely to be Dermacentor andersoni, the Rocky Mountain wood tick. Humans typically become infected in the spring and early summer. Typically, symptoms begin 2 to 14 days after a tick bite, with an average of 1 week. During the first 3 days of symptoms, an infected person usually has a fever of more than 102 degrees Fahrenheit and a severe headache. Muscle aches, nausea and vomiting are common. Between the 3rd and 5th day of fever, most people develop a rash, which usually begins on the wrists and ankles, then spreads to the arms, legs and trunk. In about two-thirds of patients, the rash also involves the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. On day 6 or later, the areas of rash may show tiny broken blood vessels and small hemorrhages under the skin. Rocky Mountain spotted fever is treated with one of the tetracycline drugs, usually doxycycline (sold as a generic), in adults and children over age 9. In general, tetracyclines should not be prescribed for pregnant women and children under the age of 9 because these antibiotics can permanently stain the teeth. However, doxycycline is the best available antibiotic to treat this potentially life threatening infection and is preferred if Rocky Mountain spotted fever is the likely diagnosis, despite the teeth staining. Chloramphenicol (Chloromycetin) is another antibiotic that attacks the bacteria, but it appears to be less effective than doxycycline and is only recommended when doxycycline cannot be given due to allergy or other reaction."

It usually starts with redness on the cheeks and nose, and also can affect the forehead and chin. The late comedian W.C. Fields, who was known for his wicked wit and red, bulbous nose, had an advanced case of rosacea. Rosacea tends to affect fair-skinned adults between ages 30 and 50 who have 'peaches and cream' complexions and a history of blushing easily."

    "Rotator cuff injury":[
        "Four tendons attach muscles from the shoulder blade and ribs to the upper arm bone (humerus). Because these tendons help to rotate the arm within its socket, this sleeve of tendons is called the rotator cuff. Tendons in the rotator cuff can be injured easily because they move within a tight space. When the shoulder is turned or lifted at the limit of its natural range of movement, the tendons in this tight space are moved, too."

    "Salivary Gland Disorders":[
        "The salivary glands make saliva and release it into the mouth. These blocked glands can cause painful symptoms: Sialolithiasis and sialadenitis, Sjögren's syndrome is another common salivary gland disorder. It occurs when white blood cells target healthy cells in moisture-producing glands, such as the salivary, sweat, and oil glands. This condition most commonly affects women with autoimmune disorders, such as lupus, Viruses can affect the salivary glands as well (These include: flu virus, mumps, Coxsackie virus, echovirus, cytomegalovirus). Treatment for salivary gland disorders depends on the disease type and how advanced it is. For example, if you have a mass in your salivary gland, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove the mass or the gland itself. If the mass is cancerous, you may need radiation treatments to kill off cancerous cells."

    "Sarcoidosis":[
        "Sarcoidosis is an illness that causes tiny islands of inflammatory cells to form throughout the body. These microscopic groups of cells are called granulomas. They are especially common in the lungs, lymph nodes, skin, eyes and liver. The cause of sarcoidosis is unknown. Sometimes, these granulomas cause very little damage, so a person with sarcoidosis does not have any symptoms of illness and may not even know they have it. In other cases, however, the granulomas produce large areas of inflammation and scarring that can interfere with an organ's normal functions. Although most people with sarcoidosis eventually recover, a few develop forms of the illness that are long-lasting (chronic) and get worse with time."

    "Scabies":[
        "Scabies is a mite infestation of the skin. The scabies mite, also known as the human itch or mange mite, causes intense itching, and it is contagious. When a person catches scabies, pregnant female mites dig burrows in the skin and lay eggs along the way. After three to eight days, the eggs hatch and the young mites travel up the burrows to the skin surface. There they grow to adulthood and mate, after which the females become pregnant and continue the skin infestation. Once a female mite finishes laying her eggs, she spends the rest of her 2-month life span at the deep end of her tunnel. Scabies mites can be transmitted by direct skin-to-skin contact with an infected person or by using clothing, blankets, sheets, towels or furniture that has touched an infected person's skin. Symptoms of scabies include: Intense itching - This itching is often worse at night, and it can involve any part of the skin, not just areas that have rash or nodules, A rash - The scabies rash typically affects the following skin surfaces: the hands, especially webbed skin between the fingers; skin folds at the wrists, knees, elbows, underarms, waist or buttocks; the genitalia; the breasts, especially the dark area around the nipple; and the shoulder blades. In adults and older children, the scabies rash often looks like tiny red bumps that are similar to small insect bites, Red or brown nodules (larger skin bumps) - In some cases, a person with scabies develops skin nodules rather than a rash. Today, topical permethrin applied to the skin (Nix, Elimite) is the usual first choice for treatment. Other medications are available and choices other than permethrin may be influenced by a person's age, pregnancy, the presence of coexisting skin conditions and medical history. Scabies medications usually are applied from neck to toe after bathing, allowed to remain on the skin for 8 to 14 hours, and then washed off. In some cases, a second application is necessary, depending on the type of medication used and your symptoms. Ivermectin (Stromectol) is an oral medication that also treats scabies effectively. It is given as a single oral dose followed by a repeat dose 2 weeks later."

    "Scarlet fever":[
        "Scarlet fever is an infection caused by Group A Streptococcus ('strep') bacteria. It causes a finely textured rash that can appear like sandpaper along with other symptoms. It usually occurs after a strep infection of the throat (strep pharyngitis, or strep throat), but occasionally after a strep skin infection. The rash of scarlet fever is caused by a toxin that the strep bacteria produce. to antibiotic treatment, patients with scarlet fever and severe throat symptoms may try: Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin and others) to relieve pain and reduce fever, Soothing gargles to fight sore throat (in adults and older children who can gargle safely), A cool-mist humidifier to soothe the breathing passages and throat, A liquid diet, including warm soups or cold milkshakes, if the patient's sore throat makes it difficult to swallow solid foods."

    "Schizophrenia":[
        "Schizophrenia is a chronic (long-lasting) brain disorder that is easily misunderstood. Although symptoms may vary widely, people with schizophrenia frequently have a hard time recognizing reality, thinking logically and behaving naturally in social situations. Schizophrenia is surprisingly common, affecting 1 in every 100 people worldwide."

    "Schizotypal personality disorder":[
        "Schizotypal personality disorder, like other personality disorders, is a long-standing pattern of behavior and experience. As part of that pattern, an individual either has difficulty functioning or experiences a great deal of distress. People with schizotypal personality disorder are loners who prefer to keep their distance from others and are uncomfortable being in relationships. They sometimes exhibit odd speech or behavior, and they have a limited or flat range of emotions. This pattern begins early in adulthood and continues throughout life."

    "Sciatica":[
        "Sciatica describes persistent pain felt along the sciatic nerve. This nerve runs from the lower back, down through the buttock and into the lower leg. It is the longest nerve in the body. Pain results when this nerve is compressed or injured. It most commonly results from inflammation, bony enlargement due to arthritis or a displaced (herniated) disk in the lower spine."

    "Scleroderma":[
        "Scleroderma is a poorly understood illness that causes widespread hardening of the skin, especially on the hands and face. It also can damage the lungs, heart, kidneys, digestive tract, muscles and joints. It is a long-lasting (chronic) autoimmune disorder, an illness in which the body's immune defenses mistakenly attack the body's own cells rather than protecting them from outside invaders. Scleroderma also is called progressive systemic sclerosis."

    "Scoliosis":[
        "A normal spine has several front-to-back curves between the neck and the pelvis. In scoliosis, the spine curves abnormally to the side or twists. Although scoliosis seems to run in some families, most cases appear for unknown reasons in children and adolescents who previously had a straight spine. Scoliosis without a known cause is called idiopathic scoliosis. Girls and boys are affected equally by idiopathic scoliosis, but girls with this condition are more likely to develop curves that get big enough to require treatment."

    "Screening for birth defects in early pregnancy":[
        "A combination of blood test results and the findings seen on a fetal ultrasound can enable doctors to identify pregnancies that are at a higher risk for birth defects. Examples of birth defects that screening can identify are Down syndrome and neural tube defects (brain and spinal cord problems). If the screening tests suggest problems, your doctor might recommend additional tests, such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling, to confirm the findings. Before having this test done, you need to think carefully about what you would do with the results once you have them. The results of these screening tests cannot show for sure whether you have either a healthy fetus or one with a problem."

    "Sebaceous Cysts":[
        "Sebaceous cysts are small lumps that arise within the skin on the face, upper back and upper chest. A sebaceous cyst can form when the opening to a sebaceous gland becomes blocked. The oily substance called sebum continues to be produced but cannot escape to the outer skin surface. Sebaceous cysts that occur in people with acne can be prevented by keeping acne under control with medication. A sebaceous cyst usually does not need to be treated unless it is inflamed (red) or is causing a cosmetic problem. Inflamed cysts usually are treated by draining the fluid and removing the shell that make up the cyst wall. You also may be treated with antibiotics if the skin around the cyst is infected. If a cyst is causing irritation or cosmetic difficulty, your physician can remove it by making a small incision in the skin and emptying the contents of the cyst and its wall."

    "Seborrheic Dermatitis":[
        "Seborrheic dermatitis is a form of skin inflammation (dermatitis) that causes a red, oily, flaking skin rash in areas of the body where glands in the skin called sebaceous glands are most abundant — the scalp, face and groin. In infants, it primarily affects the scalp, where it is called cradle cap. The causes of seborrheic dermatitis are unclear, but yeast may be involved in some cases. Although doctors recognize that seborrheic dermatitis occurs in skin areas that have many sebaceous glands, they still do not know exactly why it develops there. It is thought that a tiny yeast may play a role in seborrheic dermatitis."

    "Seborrheic keratoses":[
        "Seborrheic keratoses are benign (noncancerous) skin growths that develop from skin cells called keratinocytes. These growths have a waxy or greasy look and can be tan, brown or black. They look like they have been glued or stuck onto the skin. Over time, the growths become rough and crusty looking. Seborrheic keratoses usually appear alone, but others may develop. They usually are found on the chest and back but can appear anywhere on the body, including the face, scalp and neck."

    "Secondary Hypertension":[
        "Most people with high blood pressure are diagnosed with essential hypertension. Currently this means that no specific cause is identified for the condition.  About 6% of the time, however, high blood pressure is caused by another condition or disease. When this happens, it is called secondary hypertension."

    "Anxiolytic drug use disorder":[
        "Sedative-hypnotic drugs — sometimes called 'depressants' — and anxiolytic (antianxiety) drugs slow down the activity of the brain. Benzodiazepines (Ativan, Halcion, Librium, Valium, Xanax, Rohypnol) are the best known. An older class of drugs, called barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal, phenobarbital) fit into this broad category. Other drugs in this group include chloral hydrate (which when mixed with alcohol was once known as 'knockout drops' or a 'Mickey Finn'), glutethimide, methaqualone (Quaalude, Sopor, 'ludes') and meprobamate (Equanil, Miltown and other brand names). To help prevent problems, follow any prescription directions exactly and avoid taking more of the medication than your doctor ordered. The first goal of treatment is detoxification (withdrawal from the drug). Detoxification usually involves gradually reducing the dose of the drug or temporarily substituting a medication that has less serious withdrawal symptoms. All addictions are complex and have multiple causes. A drug use disorder is usually not an isolated problem. Commonly, people with sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic drug addictions are also struggling with other mental disorders, such as anxiety or depression."

    "Seizure":[
        "A seizure is a sudden change in the brain's normal electrical activity. During a seizure, brain cells 'fire' uncontrollably at up to four times their normal rate, temporarily affecting the way a person behaves, moves, thinks or feels. There are two major types of seizures: Primary generalized seizures – The seizure affects the entire cerebral cortex, the outer portion of the brain that contains the majority of brain cells. In this type of seizure, the abnormal firing of brain cells occurs on both sides of the brain at about the same time, Partial (focal) seizure – The abnormal firing of brain cells begins in one region of the brain and remains in that one region."

    "Sexually transmitted":[
        "Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are infections that are spread from person to person through sexual contact, including oral sex, anal sex and the sharing of sex toys. These diseases can be passed through any contact between the genitals of one person and the genitals, anus, mouth or eyes of another person. There are many different STDs, but the most common ones in the United States are herpes simplex virus type II (genital herpes), human papilloma virus, chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV and genital warts. Some infections that can be spread by sex, such as the hepatitis B virus, are not traditionally referred to as STDs because they are spread primarily by other means."

    "Shigellosis":[
        "Shigellosis is an infection of the colon (large intestine) caused by Shigella bacteria. Shigellosis is also called bacillary dysentery because it can cause severe diarrhea. However, the infection often causes only mild symptoms. Shigella can be found in water polluted with infected sewage. Bacteria commonly enter the body through a contaminated drinking supply. Shigella bacteria also can be found on food that has been rinsed with unclean water, grown in fields contaminated with sewage, or touched by flies that have touched feces. Shigella bacteria can reach the mouth on dirty fingers that have touched items soiled with feces, including dirty diapers, toilets and bathroom fixtures. To prevent the spread of Shigella bacteria, you should: Practice good hygiene, especially frequent handwashing, Wash your hands immediately after changing a child's diaper, especially if the child has diarrhea, Dispose of soiled diapers in closed-lid garbage cans, Swim only in lakes and pools whose water quality is monitored by local health officials, When traveling to developing countries, drink water that has been treated or boiled. Eat foods that have been cooked thoroughly. Don't eat unpeeled fruits. Peel fruits yourself immediately before eating them. If you have a mild case of shigellosis, you probably won't need treatment because your symptoms will probably go away on their own. Doctors may prescribe antibiotics if there are very young or very old members in your household who could get the infection."
    ],
    "Shin Splints":[
        "Shin splints are injuries that commonly occur in runners. They cause pain along the inner side of the shinbone (tibia). Shin splints develop because of overuse of the posterior tibialis muscle in the lower leg near the shin. In most cases, this overuse is related to a sudden increase in the intensity of an athlete's training program — suddenly running faster, farther or for longer periods than before. When shin splints first appear, the leg pain tends to start near the end of a training session. However, if the athlete ignores the pain tries to 'run through it', symptoms eventually will begin earlier and earlier during training, until they affect the athlete's overall performance."

    "Shingles":[
        "Shingles, also known as herpes zoster or just zoster, occurs when a virus in nerve cells becomes active again later in life and causes a skin rash. The virus that causes shingles, the varicella-zoster virus, is the same virus that causes chickenpox. It is a member of the herpes virus family. Once you have had chickenpox, varicella-zoster virus remains in your body's nerve tissues and never really goes away. It is inactive, but it can be reactivated later in life. This causes shingles. If your condition is diagnosed within 72 hours after the rash appears, your doctor may prescribe antiviral medication. Some antiviral medications used to treat shingles include acyclovir (Zovirax), famciclovir (Famvir) and valacyclovir (Valtrex). Antiviral medications may help to reduce the risk of developing chronic (long-lasting) pain from shingles. The skin rash and blisters should be rinsed gently once or twice per day with cool water. Your doctor may suggest that you use antibiotic ointment on open areas. Because the pain that accompanies shingles can be intense, your doctor probably will prescribe a pain medication."

    "Shoulder dislocation":[
        "The shoulder joint is called a ball-and-socket joint. The ball is the rounded top of the bone in the upper arm (humerus), which fits into the socket — the cup-shaped outer part of the shoulder blade. When the top of the humerus moves out of its usual location in the shoulder joint, the shoulder is said to be dislocated. A related injury called a shoulder subluxation occurs when the top of the humerus is only partially displaced and not totally out of its socket. In some cases, a shoulder is dislocated when the arm is pulled or twisted with extreme force in an outward, upward or backward direction. This extreme force literally pops the top of the humerus out of its socket. In other cases, a shoulder dislocation is the result of a fall on an outstretched arm, a direct forceful blow to the shoulder, a seizure or a severe electric shock. Seizures and shock can cause shoulder dislocations because they produce extreme, unbalanced muscle contractions that can wrench the humerus out of place."
    ],
    "Shoulder sprain":[
        "A shoulder sprain is a tear of shoulder ligaments, the tough bands of fibrous tissue that connect bones to one another inside or around the shoulder joint. Although most people think of the shoulder as a single joint between the upper arm bone (humerus) and the torso, the shoulder actually has several smaller joints outside the arm bone's socket. Ligaments connect the four bones that are important to the shoulder's function. These bones include: The triangular shoulder blade, called the scapula, The bony knob at the top of the scapula, called the acromion, The collarbone, called the clavicle, The breastbone, called the sternum."

    "Sick sinus syndrome":[
        "Sick sinus syndrome is an umbrella term that covers three heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias): sinus bradycardia, which causes a slow heart rate, tachycardias, which cause fast heart rates, often followed by a very slow heart rate. Types of tachycardias include atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter/tachycardia, and supraventricular tachycardia, bradycardia-tachycardia, which causes alternating slow and fast heart rhythms."

It causes: Chronic destruction of red blood cells, causing severe anemia, Episodes of intense pain, Vulnerability to infections, Organ damage, In some cases, early death. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. People with sickle cell anemia inherit a defective type of hemoglobin. Treatment of sickle cell anemia may include any of the following: Folic acid supplements. To ensure that enough of this nutrient is available to make new red blood cells, Daily antibiotic therapy. To protect against infection in young children, Fluids, oxygen and pain-killing medications. To manage episodes of painful crises, Blood transfusions. To treat anemia and painful crises, Hydroxyurea (Hydrea), L-glutamine (ENDARI). L- glutamine may reduce the number and severity of painful crises. It is an amino acid that can be used in adult and pediatric patients 5 years of age and older, Routine eye exams. To detect early abnormalities. These can be treated with laser coagulation and other types of eye surgery to prevent vision loss. For some children, a hematopoietic stem cell (bone marrow) transplant may cure their illness. The child has to have a sibling who is a suitable donor. However, this is a high-risk treatment. It is primarily used in those with very severe symptoms."

    "Sjogren's syndrome":[
        "Sjögren's (pronounced 'show grins') syndrome is a chronic (or lifelong) condition that causes dry mouth and dry eyes. The syndrome also can affect any of the body's glands, including those that secrete sweat, saliva and oil. Sjögren's syndrome is an autoimmune disorder, meaning the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own cells and organs. In this case, the immune system attacks the organs that normally produce lubricating fluid, including the salivary glands in the mouth and the lacrimal glands in the eye. This leads to scarring and, eventually, a marked reduction in tear and saliva production, which causes dryness of the eyes and mouth."

In severe cases, apneas can happen many hundreds of times each night. People with untreated sleep apnea are more likely to develop high blood pressure. Apneas disrupt a person's ability to get a good night's sleep, making them less alert during the day. This can lead to accidents. People with untreated sleep apnea are up to seven times more likely to be involved in motor vehicle accidents."

    "Smallpox":[
        "Smallpox is a contagious and sometimes fatal disease caused by two related viruses: variola major and variola minor. Variola major is the more common and severe form, with an overall historical fatality rate of about 30%. Variola minor is less common and causes a milder form of smallpox that is usually not fatal. Historic death rates were less than 1%. Smallpox eradication was one of the greatest successes of modern public health. Through a sophisticated global vaccination campaign, the World Health Organization officially declared in 1980 that smallpox had been eliminated worldwide. The last known case of smallpox in the United States occurred in 1949, and the last case of naturally occurring smallpox was reported in 1977 in Somalia. Today, the smallpox virus is known to exist only in secured laboratory stockpiles in the United States and Russia. However, it is theorized that other countries may have possession of the virus as well."

    "Soft Tissue Sarcoma":[
        "A sarcoma is a cancer that develops from particular tissues, such as muscle or bone. In contrast, most cancers develop from organs that contain glands, such as the breast, colon, prostate and lung, among others. There are two types of sarcoma: osteosarcoma, which develops from bone, and soft tissue sarcoma. Soft tissue sarcoma can arise from muscle, fat, nerves, cartilage, or blood vessels. Cancerous tumors can develop when abnormal cells in these tissues multiply and grow out of control. Scientists do not yet fully understand why these cells become abnormal. However, most cancers are thought to develop due to genetic changes (mutations)."

    "Spina Bifida":[
        "Spina bifida is one of a group of disorders called neural tube defects — malformations of the brain, spinal cord or their coverings. Spina bifida occurs when a fetus's developing spinal column does not close properly in the first 28 days following fertilization. The disorder can take one of three forms: Spina bifida occulta — The spinal column is not completely closed. This may not cause any symptoms and often requires no treatment, Meningocele — Part of covering of the spinal cord called the meninges may protrude through an opening in the back, Myelomeningocele — A portion of the spinal cord itself protrudes through an opening in the back. Meningoceles and myelomeningoceles may appear as saclike structures on an infant's back at birth. When most people refer to spina bifida, they are referring to the most severe form, myelomeningocele. The symptoms of spinal bifida can range from mild or severe depending on the severity of the condition itself. In myelomeningocele, the child may have muscle weakness or paralysis below the level of the incompletely closed spinal column, because nerves traveling to the rest of the body from the spinal cord do not function properly. Studies have shown that getting enough folic acid dramatically reduces a woman's chance of giving birth to a baby with spina bifida. Folic acid supplementation must begin before pregnancy takes place, because the spinal column forms so early after fertilization. In addition to its ability to prevent spina bifida, folic acid appears to reduce its severity as well."

    "Spinal Cord Trauma":[
        "The spinal cord carries nerve signals from the brain to the rest of the body. Trauma to the spinal cord can result from a number of injuries: about half occur after motor vehicle accidents; followed by falls; gunshot wounds or other violence; and sports-related injuries. The average age at injury is 42 years, and approximately 80% of those affected are male. Up to one-quarter of cases occur after significant alcohol ingestion. Pre-existing disease in the spine can make spinal cord trauma more likely. For example, complications of rheumatoid arthritis or osteoporosis may lead to spinal cord damage. Preventing spinal cord injury requires preventing traumatic injury to the spinal column, especially the neck. The leading causes of spinal cord injury include automobile accidents, falls, sports, diving accidents and firearms. To prevent spinal cord injury: Always wear your seat belt, Don't drink and drive, Dive only in water at least 9 to 12 feet deep, with your arms in front of you. Never dive into water if you don't know its depth, Wear protective equipment when playing sports or engaging in any dangerous activity, Protect yourself against falls. Emergency care, surgery (when necessary), rehabilitation and supportive care, including use of respirators, can help people with spinal cord injuries survive and make the most of their remaining neurologic function. Surgery sometimes is required to stabilize a damaged spine, to remove fragments of injured bone, discs, or foreign objects (such as bullets), to drain fluid or a blood clot that is pressing on the spinal cord."
    ],
    "Spinal Cord Tumors":[
        "The spinal cord, which lies protected inside the spine (backbones), contains bundles of nerves that transmit messages between the brain and the nerves throughout the body. A tumor on or near the spinal cord can disrupt this communication, impair function and seriously threaten health. Spinal cord tumors are masses of abnormal cells that grow in the spinal cord, between its protective sheaths, or on the surface of the sheath that covers the spinal cord. Primary spinal cord tumors develop within the spinal cord rather than spreading from other parts of the body. These primary tumors usually are noncancerous (benign) and even the cancerous ones rarely spread to other parts of the body."

    "Sprain":[
        "A sprain is a tear of ligaments, the tough bands of fibrous tissue that connect bones to one another at a joint. Normally, ligaments stabilize a joint, keep the joint's bones aligned and limit the motion of a joint to the normal range. When a joint is sprained, its torn or stretched ligaments can lose part or all of their ability to reinforce the joint and to keep it moving normally. In severe cases, the sprained joint can become unstable and loose, bones can move out of alignment and the joint may extend beyond its normal range of motion."

Eventually, tumor cells can spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body including the: lymph nodes around and between the lungs, liver, bones, adrenal glands, brain. In general, there are two categories of lung cancer: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. The cancer cells in each type look different under the microscope."

Commonly, it involves either saying a string of repeated sounds or making abnormal pauses during speech. In early childhood, stuttering is sometimes part of normal speech development. In fact, about 5% of all young children go through a brief period of stuttering when they are learning to talk. Stuttering typically is first noticed between the ages of 2 and 5. It usually goes away on its own within a matter of months. In a small number of children (around 1%), stuttering continues and may get worse. Boys are more likely to stutter than girls."

    "Styes And Chalazions":[
        "A sty, also called hordeolum, is a small abscess of the oil gland associated with an eyelash hair follicle. It typically contains Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, the cause of staph infections. When a sty develops, a small area of the upper or lower eyelid or the corner of the eye becomes red, tender and swollen. Swelling subsides gradually over a period of days after the sty develops an opening, and the pus is able to drain out. A chalazion, like a sty, is a swelling within the eyelid caused by inflammation of an oil gland. A chalazion differs from a sty in that it does not contain an active bacterial infection. A chalazion is sometimes the after effect of a sty. It is less tender but lasts longer."

    "Subarachnoid Hemorrhage":[
        "A subarachnoid hemorrhage is bleeding from a damaged artery at the surface of the brain. This bleeding often causes a sudden, severe headache. It is a medical emergency. Subarachnoid hemorrhage is a type of stroke. It can cause permanent brain damage. Blood from a subarachnoid hemorrhage pulses into the space between the brain and the skull. It mixes with the cerebrospinal fluid that cushions the brain and spinal cord. As blood flows into the cerebral spinal fluid, it increases the pressure that surrounds the brain. The increased pressure can interfere with brain function. It is almost impossible to prevent subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by an aneurysm or AVM. These blood vessel abnormalities usually do not cause any symptoms before the hemorrhage occurs. Smoking has been shown to increase the risk of forming an aneurysm, so avoiding smoking may prevent some cases of hemorrhagic stroke. When a large hemorrhage occurs in or around the brain, the entire brain is in danger because of increasing pressure within the skull. Much of the emergency treatment for hemorrhagic stroke involves measuring and lowering this pressure. Depending upon the patient's level of consciousness and intracranial pressure, he or she may need to be hooked up to a breathing machine. Also intravenous medications can be given to decrease the pressure. Blood pressure must be kept in a tight range. Blood pressure that gets too low can be even more dangerous than high readings."

    "Subdural Hematoma":[
        "A subdural hematoma occurs when a blood vessel near the surface of the brain bursts. Blood builds up between the brain and the brain's tough outer lining. The condition is also called a subdural hemorrhage. In a subdural hematoma, blood collects immediately beneath the dura mater. The dura mater is the outermost layer of the meninges. The meninges is the three-layer protective covering of the brain."

    "Sun Allergy":[
        "A sun allergy is an immune system reaction to sunlight, most often, an itchy red rash. The medical term for this condition is Polymorphous Light Eruption (PMLE). The most common locations include the 'V' of the neck, the back of the hands, the outside surface of the arms and the lower legs. In rare cases, the skin reaction may be more severe, producing hives or small blisters that may even spread to skin in clothed areas. A few of the most common types of sun allergy are: Actinic prurigo (hereditary PMLE) — This inherited form of PMLE occurs in people of American Indian background, including the American Indian populations of North, South and Central America. Photoallergic eruption — In this form of sun allergy, a skin reaction is triggered by the effect of sunlight on a chemical that has been applied to the skin (often an ingredient in sunscreen, fragrances, cosmetics or antibiotic ointments) or ingested in a drug (often a prescription medicine). Solar urticaria — This form of sun allergy produces hives (large, itchy, red bumps) on sun-exposed skin. It is a rare condition that most often affects young women. To help prevent symptoms of a sun allergy, you must protect your skin from exposure to sunlight. Try the following suggestions: Before you go outdoors apply a sunscreen that has a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or above, with a broad spectrum of protection against both ultraviolet A and ultraviolet B rays, Use a sunblock on your lips. Choose a product that has been formulated especially for the lips, with an SPF of 30 or more, Limit your time outdoors when the sun is at its peak — in most parts of the continental United States, from about 10 a.m. to 3 p.m, Wear sunglasses with ultraviolet light protection, Wear long pants, a shirt with long sleeves and a hat with a wide brim, Be aware of skin care products and medicines, especially certain antibiotics, that may trigger a photoallergic eruption."

    "Sun damaged skin":[
        "Although most people love the warmth and light of the sun, too much sun exposure can significantly damage human skin. The sun's heat dries out areas of unprotected skin and depletes the skin's supply of natural lubricating oils. In addition, the sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation can cause burning and long-term changes in the skin's structure. Staying out of the sun between 10 am and 3 pm during the summer is the best prevention. This is when the sun is at its highest peak and its rays are the strongest. If you are in the sun, you should always wear suncream and suitable clothing to cover your body. This also includes a hat to protect your face and sunglasses to protect your eyes. The treatment depends on the form of sun damage: Dry skin - You can treat this yourself by applying moisturiser regularly and staying out of the sun. Avoid hot showers and baths as this might irritate the skin more and use unscented soaps, Sunburn - You should apply aftersun cream which you can buy at any pharmacy and most supermarkets. In addition, try applying a cool compress or spray the area with cool water, and if discomfort persists, you can take anti-inflammatory medication, Wrinkles and skin colour changes - This is more difficult to reverse, and a lot of the times it is not possible to treat this, Actinic keratosis - Many topical creams can treat this and help reduce your chances of developing skin cancer. Other treatments include cryotherapy, chemical peels, laser resurfacing and photodynamic treatment, Skin cancer - It depends on your circumstance but surgery is usually the main treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer. Other treatments include cryotherapy, anti-cancer creams, photodynamic therapy, radiotherapy and electrochemotherapy."

It mainly affects the body's superficial veins — those that are seen easily near the surface of the skin, especially in the legs. Thrombophlebitis is very common in people who have varicose veins. However, it also can occur in people with medical conditions that lead to sluggish blood flow in the legs, especially pregnant women and people who are immobilized because of stroke or cancer. People who receive injections or medications intravenously (into a vein) also are more likely to get thrombophlebitis because their veins can become irritated by the tubes used or by the medication itself. Intravenous drug users are at high risk of a very serious type of thrombophlebitis that can develop into a vein infection."

    "Swallowed Object":[
        "Young children and, sometimes, older children and adults may swallow toys, coins, safety pins, buttons, bones, wood, glass, magnets, batteries or other foreign objects. These objects often pass all the way through the digestive tract in 24 to 48 hours and cause no harm. But problems may arise when objects are stuck for a long time, are sharp, are magnetic or contain corrosive materials. Complications can include tears in the esophagus (the tube that connects the mouth and stomach), movement of the object into the tissue of the esophagus, and infection."

    "Swimmer's ear":[
        "Otitis externa is an infection of the ear canal caused by bacteria or fungi. It often is called swimmer's ear because it is associated with frequent swimming. Prolonged exposure to water, which may contain certain bacteria, makes the skin of the ear canal swollen and more likely to get infected. Summer humidity also changes the skin of the ear canal, increasing the possibility of infection. Symptoms of swimmer's ear include: Itching of the ear canal, Redness of the skin of the outer ear or ear canal, Drainage from the ear canal, often yellow or green or possibly cheesy, Pain, when touching the ear or moving the jaw while chewing or talking, Decreased hearing. Swimmer's ear usually is treated with prescription eardrops. The most commonly used drops combine either acetic acid or an antibiotic with a corticosteroid to calm the inflammation. There are multiple commercial combinations available. Drops usually are placed in the ear canal three or four times per day for about five days. Follow the instructions on your prescription."

    "Syphilis":[
        "Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by a type of bacteria called Treponema pallidum. In its earliest stage, syphilis produces an open sore (ulcer) that leaks fluid filled with syphilis bacteria. Syphilis can be transmitted by contact with this ulcer or other infectious sores that form later in the disease, usually during vaginal, oral or anal sex. Pregnant women with syphilis can pass the bacteria to their babies, causing a condition known as congenital syphilis. Congenital syphilis causes a variety of skin and organ problems in infants, and it can be deadly. Pregnant women with syphilis also have about a 40% chance of having a baby that is stillborn."

    "Tachycardia":[
        "Tachycardia is a heart rate of more than 100 beats per minute. The heart normally beats at a rate of 60 to 100 times per minute, and the pulse (felt at the wrist, neck or elsewhere) matches the contractions of the heart's ventricles, the heart's two powerful lower chambers. Tachycardia can be part of the body's normal response to anxiety, fever, rapid blood loss or strenuous exercise. It also can be caused by medical problems, such as an abnormally high level of thyroid hormones, called hyperthyroidism. In some people, tachycardia is the result of a cardiac arrhythmia (a heart-generated abnormality of heart rate or rhythm). Tachycardia can also be caused by lung problems, such as pneumonia or a blood clot in one of the lung's arteries."

    "Takayasu's Arteritis":[
        "Takayasu's arteritis is a chronic (long-term) disease in which arteries become inflamed. It is also known as Takayasu's aortitis, pulseless disease and aortic arch syndrome. The name comes from the doctor who first reported the problem in 1905, Dr. Mikito Takayasu. In most cases, Takayasu's arteritis targets the aorta and its major branches, including arteries to the brain, arms and kidneys. The aorta is the body's main artery, which pumps oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Less frequently, the pulmonary artery and coronary arteries also are involved. This problem causes damage to the body's major organs; reduced or absent pulses in the arms and legs; and symptoms of poor circulation, such as a cool or cold arm or leg, muscle pains with use or exertion, or symptoms of stroke if brain arteries are narrowed or blocked.  Over time, Takayasu's arteritis can cause scarring, narrowing and abnormal ballooning of involved blood vessels. The disease can be fatal."

    "Tay Sachs":[
        "Tay-Sachs disease is an inherited disease caused by an abnormal gene. People with this abnormal gene do not have an important enzyme called hexosaminidase A (HEXA) that helps to break down a fatty material called ganglioside GM2. This material builds up in the brain, and eventually damages nerve cells and causes neurological problems. Infants usually begin to show signs of the disease between 3 months and 6 months of age. Children with Tay-Sachs disease can become deaf, blind and paralyzed, and usually die by the age of 5."

    "Tear Duct Infection":[
        "Dacryocystitis is an infection in the tear drainage system. Tears drain from each eye through small canals, a tear sac (lacrimal sac) and a tear duct (nasolacrimal duct). Tears are made by a small organ above the eye under the upper lid. At the inner corner of each upper and lower eyelid is an opening to a small tube (drainage canal). The drainage canals carry away tears that have rinsed the front surface of the eye away so fresh tears can come in. The drainage canals empty into tear sacs, one for each eye. The tear sacs sit at the top of the tear duct. Tears move through the sac into the duct and then are dumped into your nose. Tears spill out of the eyes and into the back of your nose when you cry, although the tears entering the nose are not visible. That's why you get a runny nose when you cry. Typical symptoms of acute tear duct infection include: Pain, redness and swelling of the lower eyelid at the inner corner of the eye, Excessive tearing, Pus or discharge from the eye, Fever. Antibiotics that can be taken by mouth are the standard treatment for tear duct infection. However, a severe infection requires initial intravenous antibiotics and observation in the hospital. In general, antibiotics clear up acute infections quickly. Antibiotics are also used to treat chronic infections. In some cases, antibiotic ointment or eye drops may be prescribed. Do not attempt to apply an over-the-counter antibiotic ointment to the eye or the area around the eye, since over-the-counter ointments are not made for use in the eye and could have irritating ingredients."

    "Telogen Effluvium":[
        "At any given time, about 85% to 90% of the hairs on the average person's head are actively growing (the anagen phase) and the others are resting (the telogen phase). Typically, a hair is in the anagen phase for two to four years, then enters the telogen phase, rests for about two to four months, and then falls out and is replaced by a new, growing hair. The average person naturally loses about 100 hairs a day. In a person with telogen effluvium, some body change or shock pushes more hairs into the telogen phase. Typically in this condition, about 30% of the hairs stop growing and go into the resting phase before falling out. So if you have telogen effluvium, you may lose an average of 300 hairs a day instead of 100."

    "Tendonitis":[
        "Tendons are tough, flexible, fibrous bands of tissue that connect muscles to bones. When tendons become inflamed or irritated the condition is called tendonitis. Tendons can be small, like the delicate, tiny bands in the hands, or large, like the heavy, ropelike cords that anchor the calf or thigh muscles. In most cases, the cause of tendonitis is unknown; when a cause can be identified, the condition usually happens for one of two reasons: Overuse – A particular body motion is repeated too often, Overload – The level of a certain activity, such as weightlifting, is increased too quickly. In general, tendonitis causes pain in the tissues surrounding a joint, especially after the joint is used too much during play or work. In some cases, the joint may feel weak, and the area may be red, swollen and warm to the touch. The quicker your tendonitis is treated, the sooner you'll recover full strength and flexibility. Your doctor first may recommend that you apply ice packs to the painful area for 20-minute periods, three or four times a day. You also should ice the area immediately after any activity that aggravates your pain (such as tennis or running). To relieve pain and swelling, your doctor may suggest that you take ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin and others), aspirin or another nonprescription anti-inflammatory medication, for up to several weeks. Depending on the location and severity of tendonitis, you may need temporary splinting, bracing or a sling (for tendonitis in the upper extremity). However, it is important to gently and regularly move the joint to avoid getting a stiff, or 'frozen', joint.  This is particularly important for tendonitis involving the shoulder."

    "Tennis Elbow":[
        "Tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis) is inflammation of the fibrous tissue (tendon) that connects muscle to bone in the elbow. It is a form of tendonitis. In tennis elbow, the tendons on the outside of the elbow (the lateral epicondyle) are affected. In golfer's elbow (medial epicondylitis), another form of tendonitis, the tendons on the inside of the elbow are affected. The inflamed tendons may be strained or have tiny tears caused by overusing the muscles that control the wrist and fingers."

    "Tension Headache":[
        "Tension headaches are the most common type of headache. These headaches are not caused by disease. They are often considered to be 'normal' headaches. Other names for tension headaches are ordinary headaches, muscle tension headaches, and stress headaches. The main symptom of a tension headache is a sense of tightness around the head. This is sometimes described as a 'tight hat-band' or 'vise' sensation. Infrequent episodic tension-type headaches. Over-the-counter pain relievers are convenient, effective and relatively safe. Examples include aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin). Some people get more pain relief with combination products containing caffeine. Frequent episodic and chronic tension-type headaches. These headaches are more difficult to treat. Rebound headaches are common when pain relievers are stopped. Therapy to prevent the headache before it starts is a better strategy than taking pain relievers after the headache is present."

    "Testicular Cancer":[
        "Testicular cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in one or both testicles (testes). The testicles are the male sex glands. They are located in the scrotum, behind the penis. They produce testosterone and other male hormones. The testicles also produce and store sperm, the male cells needed for reproduction. Once testicular cancer develops, it can remain within the testicle, or it can spread to lymph nodes in the abdomen or pelvis. If it is not detected and treated, testicular cancer eventually can spread to the lungs, brain, liver, and other parts of the body. Certain types of testicular cancer are more likely to spread than others. Sometimes the cancer will have already spread at the initial time of diagnosis."
    ],
    "Testicular Torsion":[
        "Torsion of the testicle is an uncommon but serious condition in which the testicle twists on the cord that provides its blood supply. The twisting of this cord cuts off the blood supply to the testicle. It is extremely painful and must be treated immediately to prevent permanent damage to the testicle. Testicular torsion can happen after strenuous exercise or an injury, but it also can occur without any apparent cause. The condition can occur at any age but is most common between the ages of 10 and 20. Sudden onset of severe pain and extreme tenderness in one testicle, with or without an obvious cause, is the most striking symptom. Other symptoms include nausea and vomiting associated with the pain, and swelling on one side of the scrotum."

    "Tetanus":[
        "Tetanus, also called lockjaw, is a life-threatening infection caused by Clostridium tetani bacteria. Although these bacteria are especially common in the soil and manure of farms, they can be found almost anywhere. They live in the dirt of suburban gardens and in the dirty waters of floods. They also contaminate dust in cities. Tetanus bacteria usually enter the body through a dirty puncture wound, cut, scrape or some other break in the skin. Once inside the skin, they multiply and produce a toxin, or poison, that affects the body's nerves. This toxin causes severe muscle spasms, cramps and seizures. Spasms in the jaw muscles produce lockjaw. Spasms also occur in muscles of the throat, chest, abdomen and extremities. If you don't receive proper treatment, the toxin's effect on respiratory muscles can interfere with breathing. If this happens, you may die of suffocation. On average, symptoms of tetanus begin seven to eight days after tetanus bacteria enter the body. These symptoms may include: Spasms in the jaw muscles (lockjaw), Stiff muscles in the neck, shoulder and back, Difficulty swallowing, Prolonged contraction of the facial muscles, which may produce what looks like a sneer or grimace, An arched back resulting from contraction of the back muscles, Muscle spasms and muscle rigidity in the chest, abdomen and extremities, Fever and profuse sweating, High blood pressure, Rapid or irregular heartbeat, Seizures, Difficulty breathing, Fractured bones and ruptured muscles caused by severe muscle spasms. If you seek medical care for a wound, your doctor will ask you when you had your last tetanus shot. If your tetanus immunization is not up-to-date, the doctor will give you a tetanus booster. However, this booster shot will not produce immunity right away, so you may receive tetanus immune globulin as well. If you have full-blown tetanus, you will be treated in a hospital. There you will receive tetanus immune globulin to neutralize the tetanus toxin. Your muscle spasms will be treated with muscle relaxants, and you also may be sedated."

    "Throat Cancer":[
        "Throat cancer occurs when cells in the organs used for breathing, speaking, and swallowing begin to divide rapidly and abnormally. Most throat cancer begins on the vocal cords. Later, it spreads to the voice box (larynx); to the back of the throat, including part of the tongue and the tonsils (this whole area is called the pharynx); or below the voice box to the subglottis and trachea (windpipe). An early symptom of throat cancer is unexplained hoarseness or a raspy voice. Smokers are at high risk of throat cancer. Other people at risk include those who drink a lot of alcohol, especially if they also smoke. People with a vitamin A deficiency and certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection also may be more likely to develop throat cancer."

    "Thrombocytopenia":[
        "Thrombocytopenia is an abnormally low level of platelets in the blood. Platelets are made by the bone marrow. They help your blood to clot. People with thrombocytopenia can have excessive bleeding. This condition can occur in varying degrees. The risk of bleeding increases as the platelet count decreases. If you already have had one episode of drug-induced thrombocytopenia, the problem is likely to return if you take the same medication again. To help prevent this, record the name of the specific medication that caused the problem. Tell every health care professional that you visit about your sensitivity to this drug. If your thrombocytopenia is mild and is not causing any significant bleeding, you may not need treatment. This is often the standard strategy in children with acute ITP. Patients with very low platelet counts and/or significant bleeding will need more aggressive treatment. Options for treatment include: Platelet transfusions - Transfusions of platelets usually are reserved for patients with very low platelet counts or active bleeding, Medications - For patients with decreased production of platelets, doctors may prescribe Romiplostim injections or other medications to stimulate the bone marrow to make more platelets. Splenectomy (surgical removal of the spleen). This may be necessary if ITP that has not improved with other treatment. If the spleen is removed, thrombocytopenia goes away in more than half of ITP patients. If removing the spleen doesn't help, immunosuppressive drugs may be given."

    "Thromboembolism":[
        "A deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot (thrombus) that forms inside deep veins in your legs or pelvis. The clot blocks blood flow and causes pressure to build up in the vein. Part of the clot can break away and move through your bloodstream to your lungs. If the clot blocks one or more of the blood vessels in your lungs, it is called a pulmonary embolism. DVT is a common problem. Most of these clots occur when blood flow in the veins of the legs is slowed. If you have had a DVT or pulmonary embolism, or you have a family history of blood-clotting problems, you can help prevent blood clots. Do the following: Ask your doctor if you have any risk factors for blood clots that can be changed, Avoid all medications that may cause blood clots. These include birth control pills and other medications that contain estrogen, Drink a lot of water and walk around frequently when on long plane flights or car trips, Avoid prolonged periods of bed rest, Discuss your history of DVT and pulmonary embolism with your physician before considering any surgical procedures. The initial treatment for a DVT or pulmonary embolism is heparin or one of the direct oral anticoagulant drugs, referred to as DOACs. These medications act on certain blood proteins to prevent new blood clot formation and therefore help unwanted clots get smaller. They are commonly called 'blood thinners'. There are two main types of heparin. The oldest type of heparin is best administered by a constant intravenous infusion. Another type of heparin is called low-molecular-weight heparin. It is injected under the skin once or twice per day. Some foods—especially green, leafy vegetables that contain large amounts of vitamin K—can alter the blood-thinning action of warfarin. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for a list of these foods. You can continue to eat these foods as long as you eat approximately the same amount of them each day. That way, the effect on your medication will be consistent."

    "Thrombotic Stroke":[
        "In a thrombotic stroke, a blood clot (thrombus) forms inside one of the brain's arteries. The clot blocks blood flow to a part of the brain. This causes brain cells in that area to stop functioning and die quickly. The blood clot that triggers a thrombotic stroke usually forms inside an artery that already has been narrowed by atherosclerosis. This is a condition in which fatty deposits (plaques) build up inside blood vessels. Symptoms can include: Headache, Dizziness or confusion, Weakness or paralysis on one side of the body, Sudden, severe numbness in any part of the body, Visual disturbance, including sudden loss of vision, Difficulty walking, including staggering or veering, Coordination problems in the arms and hands, Slurred speech or inability to speak. If blood circulation in the brain is restored within minutes to a few hours, the person can recover rapidly, within hours to a day. For a small thrombotic stroke (lacunar stroke), symptoms often improve within a few days, even if the blood clot has not dissolved. You can help to prevent thrombotic strokes. You and your doctor should carefully manage the factors that put you at risk of atherosclerosis. Other things you can do to prevent stroke are to avoid drinking too much alcohol and never take cocaine or amphetamines."

    "Thyroid Cancer":[
        "Thyroid cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland is shaped like a butterfly. It is located under the Adam's apple in the front of the neck. Most cases of thyroid cancer can be cured. One of the functions of the thyroid gland is to make thyroid hormone, which requires iodine. The gland collects iodine from foods, concentrates it, and produces thyroid hormone. Doctors often exploit this important function when treating thyroid cancer."

    "Tick Bites":[
        "Ticks are tiny, biting arachnids that feed on the blood of warm-blooded animals, including humans. They burrow painlessly into the skin with their feeding parts, bite, draw blood and eventually drop off when they become engorged with blood. Only the feeding parts are inserted into the skin. The body, which is dark in color and ranges from the size of a poppy seed to a pencil eraser, remains visible on the skin surface or scalp. Ticks swell and turn bluish-gray when filled with blood. Most tick bites in the United States involve hard ticks (Ixodidae), which have been increasing in number since the middle 1900s. Most tick bites do not cause any symptoms. However, the following symptoms can develop as a reaction to tick secretions: Fever, Headache, Muscle pain, Joint pain, Fatigue, Muscle weakness. Skin reactions include: Pus-filled bumps, Hardened skin elevations, Nodules (granulomas) that, in rare cases, can grow large enough to require surgical removal. To prevent tick bites in tick-infested areas, take the following precautions: When in the woods, walk on cleared trails. Avoid walking through tall grass and low brush in wooded areas. Wear light-colored clothing covering both the arms and legs, Tuck pant legs into socks, Treat clothing and skin with tick repellents containing diethyltoluamide (DEET), or use the pesticide permethrin on clothing (but not skin), Thoroughly check yourself, children and pets for ticks after spending time in tick-infested areas. Remember to check the scalp. If one tick is found, check for more."

        "Many microorganisms normally live on our skin, including a group of yeast species called Malassezia. (Round or oval yeasts in this group were previously known by the names Pityrosporum orbiculare and Pityrosporum ovalis.) The yeast lives in our pores. Under certain conditions, it can shift its form from a round or oval yeast shape to a string-like, branching shape. These branching forms are named hyphae. The yeast can migrate under the skin and produce azelaic acid, a substance that can change the amount of pigment (color) in new skin cells. In its hyphae form, the yeast causes a rash called tinea versicolor, also called pityriasis versicolor."

    "Toenail Fungus":[
        "Toenail fungus is a condition that disfigures and sometimes destroys the nail. It is also called onychomycosis. Toenail fungus can be caused by several different types of fungi. Fungi are microscopic organisms related to mold and mildew. These fungi thrive in the dark, moist and stuffy environment inside shoes. As they grow, fungi feed on keratin. Keratin is the protein that makes up the hard surface of the toenails. To help to prevent toenail fungus: Wear comfortable shoes and hosiery that allow your feet some breathing space, Wear shoes, sandals or flip-flops in community showers or locker rooms, Wash your feet every day. Dry them thoroughly, and use a good-quality foot powder, Wear clean socks or stockings every day, Keep your toenails trimmed, Disinfect pedicure tools before you use them. Treatment may begin with your doctor removing as much of the infected nail as possible. This can be done by trimming the nail with clippers or filing it down. If the infection is mild and limited to a small area of your nail, your doctor can prescribe a topical antifungal agent in the form of a cream, solution or medicated nail polish."

    "Torn Meniscus":[
        "A meniscus is a disk-shaped piece of cartilage that acts as a shock absorber inside a joint. Each knee has one lateral meniscus under the outer knob of the thighbone and one medial meniscus under the inner knob of the thighbone. Each meniscus acts as a natural cushion between the thighbone (femur) and shinbone (tibia). The two cushions prevent excess wear and tear inside the knee joint by keeping the ends of the two bones from rubbing together. Each meniscus also absorbs much of the shock of jumps and landings and helps to distribute joint fluid evenly to lubricate and nourish the knee."

    "Torsional Deformity":[
        "The dictionary defines pigeon-toed as 'having the toes turned inward'. No such colorful term can be found for feet that point outward. Both of these foot problems can be caused by a problem that doctors call torsional deformities. This is when the long bones of the leg are turned to the inside or outside so that the toes of the feet do not point straight ahead. Either of the two main bones in the leg can be affected the femur (between the hip and the knee) or the tibia (the larger of the two bones between the knee and the ankle). One or both legs can be affected. Torsional deformities can lead to toes that point inward (in-toeing) or toes that point outward (out-toeing)."

    "Toxic Shock Syndrome":[
        "Toxic shock syndrome is a rare, life-threatening illness triggered by certain bacteria (group A streptococcal and Staphylococcus aureus). In toxic shock syndrome, toxins (poisons) produced by the bacteria cause a severe drop in blood pressure (hypotension) and organ failure. In some patients, these bacteria enter the body through an obvious break in the skin, such as a wound or puncture. Other cases are related to the use of tampons. Sometimes, however, toxic shock develops after a relatively mild injury, such as a bruise or muscle strain, or no cause is identified at all. Symptoms of toxic shock include: Flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, Hypotension (low blood pressure) with a weak and rapid pulse, A red rash that covers the whole body, sometimes followed by peeling skin (the rash may be difficult to see in dark-skinned individuals), Decreased urine output, Confusion, disorientation or other mental changes, Swelling in the hands, feet and ankles, Severe breathing difficulties. Patients with toxic shock syndrome are hospitalized and treated with: Intravenous fluids and certain medicines to raise blood pressure and improve blood flow to vital organs, Antibiotics to eliminate the bacteria causing the infection and releasing the toxin. Mechanical ventilation, dialysis or other supportive measures may be necessary if vital organs fail."

    "Toxoplasmosis":[
        "Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic infection that infects a large proportion of the world's population, but rarely causes disease. Certain people, however, are at high risk of severe or life-threatening disease from this parasite. They include infants who are infected at birth, people with AIDS, people with cancer, and people who have had bone marrow or organ transplantation. Toxoplasmosis is an infection caused by Toxoplasma gondii, a single-celled parasite that spends most of its life cycle inside cats. Because an infected cat can pass millions of Toxoplasma parasites daily in its feces, toxoplasmosis can spread easily to almost any other animal that shares the environment with cats. In humans, Toxoplasma parasites usually enter the body by being swallowed. This can happen when people touch their mouth with soiled hands, especially after changing cat litter, or if they eat pork, lamb or venison that has not been cooked thoroughly."

    "Transient Ischemic Attack":[
        "A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is an episode of stroke-like symptoms. It usually lasts less than one hour. A TIA is sometimes called a mini stroke. During a TIA, circulation to a part of the brain is interrupted briefly, and then restored. This interruption can be caused by: A narrowing of a brain artery because of atherosclerosis, A small floating blood clot. This clot enters the bloodstream from somewhere else in the body, often the heart. It temporarily blocks a brain artery. When treating TIAs, the ultimate goal is to prevent a full-fledged stroke. Most TIAs are treated with antiplatelet medications. The choices include: Aspirin only, Aspirin combined with dipyridamole (Aggrenox), Clopidogrel (Plavix), Both aspirin and clopidogrel. If you have significant narrowing of part of the carotid artery in the neck, surgery may be done to correct the problem. This will help prevent future TIAs and stroke. The procedure is called carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting."

        "In a normal hip joint, the rounded top of the thigh bone (femur) fits into a cup-shaped socket in the pelvis called the acetabulum. This type of joint is called a ball-and-socket joint. When the top of the femur moves out of its normal position in the socket, the hip is said to be disclocated. A hip can become dislocated during many kinds of accidents, including falls from high places and motorcycle or car accidents. When this injury occurs in a head-on car crash, it is often nicknamed a 'dashboard dislocatio', because it happens when the knee strikes the dashboard."

Urinary tract infections often are classified into two types based on their location in the urinary tract: Lower tract infections — These include cystitis (bladder infection) and urethritis (infection of the urethra). Lower urinary tract infections commonly are caused by intestinal bacteria, which enter and contaminate the urinary tract from below, usually by spreading from the skin to the urethra and then to the bladder, Upper tract infections — These involve the ureters and kidneys and include pyelonephritis (kidney infection). Upper tract infections often occur because bacteria have traveled upward in the urinary tract from the bladder to the kidney or because bacteria carried in the bloodstream have collected in the kidney. Most cases of urinary tract infections occur in women. Of those that occur in men, relatively few affect younger men. In men older than 50, the prostate gland (a gland near the bottom of the bladder, close to the urethra) can enlarge and block the flow of urine from the bladder."

Doctors often divide urinary tract infections into two types, lower tract infections and upper tract infections: Lower tract infections — Infection of the bladder is called cystitis (bladder infection). Bacteria normally found in the intestine are the main cause of lower urinary tract infections. These bacteria spread from the anus to the urethra and bladder, where they grow, invade the tissue and cause infection, Upper tract infections — These involve the ureters and kidneys. These infections are called pyelonephritis or kidney infections. Upper urinary tract infections usually occur because bacteria travel up from the bladder into the kidney. Sometimes, they occur when bacteria travel from other areas of the body through the bloodstream and settle in the kidney."

        "Tropical sprue is a digestive problem that occurs in the tropics and subtropics. People with tropical sprue do not absorb nutrients properly, especially vitamin B12 and folic acid. Normal small intestines have fingerlike projections called villi that provide more surface area for nutrients to be absorbed. In people with tropical sprue, these villi are flattened, making absorption difficult."

    "Tuberculosis":[
        "Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection that kills approximately 1.5 million people a year. Most of these deaths occur in developing countries. The bacterium that usually causes tuberculosis in humans is Mycobacterium tuberculosis. About one-third of the world's population is infected with tuberculosis. However, most do not show signs of the disease. In these people, the bacteria are inactive (latent) and cannot be transmitted to others. If the body's immune system weakens, tuberculosis can become active and cause disease."

    "Type 1 diabetes mellitus":[
        "Type 1 diabetes is a disease in which the body does not make enough insulin to control blood sugar levels. Type 1 diabetes was previously called insulin-dependent diabetes or juvenile diabetes. During digestion, food is broken down into basic components. Carbohydrates are broken down into simple sugars, primarily glucose.  Glucose is a critically important source of energy for the body's cells.  To provide energy to the cells, glucose needs to leave the blood and get inside the cells. Type 1 diabetes occurs when some or all of the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas are destroyed. This leaves the patient with little or no insulin. Without insulin, sugar accumulates in the bloodstream rather than entering the cells. As a result, the body cannot use this glucose for energy.  In addition, the high levels of glucose that remain in the blood cause excessive urination and dehydration, and damage tissues of the body. Treatment of type 1 diabetes requires daily insulin injections. The injected insulin makes up for the insulin that is not produced by the body. Most people with type 1 diabetes need two to four injections per day. People with type 1 diabetes must properly regulate both their dietary intake and their dose of insulin. If a person takes too much insulin relative to their dietary intake, or if they forget to eat, they can develop dangerous hypoglycemia.  If they take too little insulin, or eat too much, they can develop ketoacidosis."
    ],
    "Type 2 diabetes mellitus":[
        "Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease. It is characterized by high levels of sugar in the blood. Type 2 diabetes is also called type 2 diabetes mellitus and adult-onset diabetes. That's because it used to start almost always in middle- and late-adulthood. However, more and more children and teens are developing this condition. Type 2 diabetes is much more common than type 1 diabetes, and is really a different disease.  But it shares with type 1 diabetes high blood sugar levels, and the complications of high blood sugar. During digestion, food is broken down into basic components. Carbohydrates are broken down into simple sugars, primarily glucose. Glucose is a critically important source of energy for the body's cells. To provide energy to the cells, glucose needs to leave the blood and get inside the cells. The symptoms of diabetes are related to high blood glucose levels. They include: Excessive urination, thirst and hunger, Weight loss, Increased susceptibility to infections, especially yeast or fungal infections, Extremely high blood sugar levels also can lead to a dangerous complication called hyperosmolar syndrome. In most cases, type 2 diabetes treatment begins with weight reduction through diet and exercise. A healthy diet for a person with diabetes is: Low in saturated fats and cholesterol, Without any trans fats, Low in total calories, Nutritionally balanced with abundant amounts of: Whole-grain foods, Monounsaturated oils, Fruits and vegetables. Metformin. Oral metformin remains the first go-to drug in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. It's available as a generic, so it's very affordable. Also metformin does not cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) when used alone. Weight loss. Both can help a person with diabetes shed pounds. But the GLP-1 receptor agonists are more effective for weight reduction compared with the SGLT-2 inhibitors. Heart disease. Drugs from both classes lower the risk of heart attack and stroke in people with diabetes. Because type 2 diabetes develops when the pancreas cannot make enough insulin to overcome insulin resistance. In advanced type 2 diabetes, or for people who want to tightly control glucose levels, insulin may be needed more than once per day and in higher doses. In addition to medicines that help control the level of blood sugar, people with type 2 diabetes often take other medicines that reduce the risk or to slow the onset of the complications of diabetes."

    "Ulcerative Colitis":[
        "Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease. It usually begins in the rectum, then worsens to involve some or all of the large intestine. Ulcerative colitis is a lifelong condition. Ulcerative colitis may begin with a breakdown in the lining of the intestine. The inside of the intestine, with its digested food, contains trillions of bacteria. Normally, the lining of the intestines keeps these bacteria from causing an infection of the wall of the intestine. Ulcerative colitis affects the inner lining of the rectum and colon. This causes the lining to: Wear away in spots (leaving ulcers), Bleed, Ooze cloudy mucus or pus. Typical symptoms include: Cramping abdominal pain, especially in the lower abdomen, Bloody diarrhea, often containing pus or mucus, Little warning before you need to have a bowel movement, The need to wake from sleep to have bowel movements. Medications are very effective for improving the symptoms of ulcerative colitis. Most of the medications used work by preventing inflammation in the intestine. Surgery is used in people who have: Severe symptoms that are not controlled by medicines, Unacceptable side effects from medicines, A very high risk of colon cancer because of extensive inflammation in the whole colon. After some surgeries, bowel movements will have to leave the body through an opening in the abdominal wall."

    "Undescended Testicle":[
        "An undescended testicle, also called cryptorchidism, is a testicle that has not moved down into the scrotum. Early in pregnancy, the testicles begin developing deep within the abdomen, influenced by several hormones. At 32 to 36 weeks' gestation, the testicles begin to descend into the scrotum. In 30% of premature and approximately 3% of full-term male infants, one or both of the testicles have not completed their descent at the time of birth. Most of these will then descend spontaneously during the first three to six months of life."

    "Urethritis":[
        "Urethritis is an inflammation of the urethra, which is the tube that carries urine out of the body. Urethritis is usually caused by a sexually transmitted infection. Much less often, it is the result of an injury from an instrument such as a urinary catheter or exposure to an irritating chemical such as an antiseptic or a spermicide."

    "Urinary Health":[
        "The urinary tract includes the kidneys, the ureters (the tubes connecting the kidneys to the bladder), the bladder, and the urethra (the tube that allows urine to exit from the bladder to outside the body)."
    ],
    "Urinary Incontinence":[
        "Urinary incontinence is a loss of control over urination. Urine leaks before you are able to get to a toilet. Normally, kidneys make urine that travels through tubes (called ureters) into the bladder.  The bladder is a balloon-shaped structure with walls of muscle.  The muscular walls are relaxed until the bladder fills up.  The underside of the bladder is supported by pelvic floor muscles. When the bladder is full, the walls of the bladder are stretched. That signals the muscular walls to squeeze down, causing an urge to urinate.  When you are ready to urinate, the muscular walls squeeze down harder, and another tube (the urethra) opens up that carries urine out of the bladder and into the outside world. With the various types of urinary incontinence, this normal process gets disrupted."
    ],
    "Urinary tract infection in men":[
        "Urinary tract infections involve the parts of the body — the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra — that produce urine and carry it out of the body. Urinary tract infections often are classified into two types based on their location in the urinary tract: Lower tract infections — These include cystitis (bladder infection) and urethritis (infection of the urethra). Lower urinary tract infections commonly are caused by intestinal bacteria, which enter and contaminate the urinary tract from below, usually by spreading from the skin to the urethra and then to the bladder, Upper tract infections — These involve the ureters and kidneys and include pyelonephritis (kidney infection). Upper tract infections often occur because bacteria have traveled upward in the urinary tract from the bladder to the kidney or because bacteria carried in the bloodstream have collected in the kidney. Most cases of urinary tract infections occur in women. Of those that occur in men, relatively few affect younger men."
    ],
    "Urinary tract infection in women":[
        "A urinary tract infection is an infection involving the organs that produce urine and carry it out of the body. These structures include the kidneys, ureters (long, slender tubes connecting the kidneys with the bladder), bladder and urethra. Doctors often divide urinary tract infections into two types, lower tract infections and upper tract infections: Lower tract infections — Infection of the bladder is called cystitis (bladder infection). Bacteria normally found in the intestine are the main cause of lower urinary tract infections. These bacteria spread from the anus to the urethra and bladder, where they grow, invade the tissue and cause infection, Upper tract infections — These involve the ureters and kidneys. These infections are called pyelonephritis or kidney infections. Upper urinary tract infections usually occur because bacteria travel up from the bladder into the kidney. Sometimes, they occur when bacteria travel from other areas of the body through the bloodstream and settle in the kidney."
    ],
    "Uterine and Bladder Prolapse":[
        "The uterus and the bladder are held in their normal positions just above the inside end of the vagina by a 'hammock' made up of supportive muscles and ligaments. Wear and tear on these supportive structures in the pelvis can allow the bottom of the uterus, the floor of the bladder or both to sag through the muscle and ligament layers. When this occurs, the uterus or bladder can create a bulge into the vagina. In severe cases, it is possible for the sagging uterus or bladder to work its way down far enough that the bulge can appear at the vagina's opening or even protrude from the opening."
    ],
    "Uveitis":[
        "Uveitis means inflammation of the part of the eye called the uvea. The uvea, also called the uveal tract, is a continuous layer of fibrous tissue that surrounds the eye. It is made up of three structures: The iris — The donut-shaped part that gives the eye its color, The choroid — A membrane full of tiny blood vessels that lines the eye, The ciliary body — A thick ring of tissue that helps control the shape of the lens, and is attached to the iris and to the front portion of the choroid."
    ],
    "Vaginal Atrophy":[
        "Vaginal atrophy is a change of the vagina that develops when there is a significant decrease in levels of the female hormone estrogen. The condition also is called atrophic vaginitis. Estrogen, which is produced by the ovaries, plays a vital role in keeping vaginal tissues lubricated and healthy. When levels of estrogen are low, vaginal tissue becomes atrophic — thin, dry and shrunken. The vagina may become more prone to inflammation in an atrophic state."
    ],
    "Vaginal Discharge":[
        "Normally, vaginal discharge is clear or white. It may become stretchy and slippery during ovulation, about two weeks after your menstrual period. A change in the color or amount of discharge, accompanied by other symptoms, may indicate that you have an infection. The vagina normally contains bacteria. Bacterial growth is controlled and affected by many different factors, such as acid level (pH) and hormones. Anything that upsets this balance may increase your risk of infection or overgrowth of any of the normal bacteria or by yeast."
    ],
    "Vaginal Yeast Infection":[
        "Vaginal yeast infections, also called 'Candida vaginal infections', typically are caused by the Candida albicans fungus. During a lifetime, 75% of all women are likely to have at least one vaginal Candida infection, and up to 45% have two or more. Women tend to be more likely to get vaginal yeast infections if their bodies are under stress from poor diet, lack of sleep, illness, or when they are pregnant or taking antibiotics. Women with immune-suppressing diseases such as diabetes and HIV infection also are at increased risk. The symptoms of a vaginal yeast infection include: Vaginal itch or soreness, Thick, white, cheese-like discharge, 'Burning' discomfort around the vaginal opening, especially if urine touches the area, Pain or discomfort during sexual intercourse."

    "Vaginitis":[
        "Vaginitis is inflammation of the vagina. In premenopausal women, infection is the most common cause. After menopause, a low level of estrogen often leads to vaginal atrophy (atrophic vaginitis). Vaginitis also can be the result of an allergic reaction to an irritating chemical, such as a spermicide, douche or bath soap."

    "Vascular Birthmarks":[
        "A vascular birthmark is a discoloration of the skin that is caused by blood vessels that don't form correctly. They are present at birth or appear shortly after birth. There are three major types of vascular birthmarks: Salmon patch (nevus simplex) is a flat patch of pink or red skin, often small, usually with poorly defined borders. Salmon patches may be seen in as many as 1 out of every 3 newborns. They typically are found at the nape of the neck ('stork bite'), on the forehead between the eyebrows ('angel's kiss') or on the eyelids. Often, they are more noticeable during crying or changes in temperature, Hemangioma is a raised bright red spot, often small, usually soft and compressible, with well-defined borders. It occurs most commonly on the face, scalp, chest or back. It may be present at birth but more often appears during the first month of life. While many hemangiomas will become less noticeable over time, some may grow quite rapidly, Port-wine stain (nevus flammeus) is a flat patch of purple or dark red skin, often large, usually with well-defined borders. It usually is on one side of the face or neck and is present at birth. (Mikhail Gorbachev, former president of the Soviet Union, has a port-wine stain on his forehead.) Port-wine stains affect less than 1% of infants. In rare cases, they are associated with other abnormalities."
    ],
    "Vasculitis":[
        "Vasculitis means inflammation of blood vessels. The inflammation can be short term (acute) or long term (chronic), and it can be so severe that it reduces blood flow to tissues and organs. This can cause dangerous organ and tissue damage, especially when vasculitis affects blood vessels in the brain, lungs, kidneys or other vital areas. The treatment of vasculitis depends on its cause: Polyarteritis nodosa – This form of vasculitis usually is treated with prednisone (sold under several brand names) and, in most cases, an additional immunosuppressant such as cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan, Neosar), azathioprine (Imuran), methotrexate (Rheumatrex, others), mycophenolate (Cellcept) or rituximab (Rituxan), Cutaneous leukocytoclastic angiitis – This form often goes away on its own without treatment. Any newly started medication that may have triggered the vasculitis should be stopped, if possible. For severe cases, corticosteroids may be given, Giant cell arteritis – Treatment begins with high doses of prednisone, which gradually are reduced over many months. If symptoms return, steroid treatment may be necessary for a year or more. Additional medications, such as tocilizumab (Actemra) or methotrexate (Rheumatrex, and others), may be recommended, Granulomatosis with polyangiitis – Standard treatment includes prednisone along with cyclophosphamide or rituximab. Methotrexate (Rheumatrex, and others), azathioprine (Imuran), mycophenolate (Cellcept) or other immune-suppressing medications may be used for maintenance therapy or when initial treatments are not effective, Takayasu's arteritis – Corticosteroids are used to treat this condition. However, other immune suppressing medications may be recommended if improvement is not adequate with corticosteroids alone. Narrowed arteries may need to be corrected with surgery or angioplasty (inserting a balloon-tipped catheter to widen the vessels), Kawasaki disease – Treatment includes aspirin and a drug called gamma globulin given in high doses intravenously (into a vein) to reduce the risk of coronary artery damage. In some cases, corticosteroid therapy is recommended as well."

    "Vertigo":[
        "Vertigo is the sensation that either your body or your environment is moving (usually spinning). Vertigo can be a symptom of many different illnesses and disorders. The most common causes of vertigo are illnesses that affect the inner ear, including: Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo  — In this condition, a change in head position causes a sudden sensation of spinning. The most likely cause is small crystals that break loose in the canals of the inner ear and touch the sensitive nerve endings inside, Acute labyrinthitis, also called vestibular neuritis  — This is an inflammation of the balance apparatus of the inner ear, probably caused by a viral infection, Ménière's disease — This causes repeat episodes of dizziness, usually with ringing in the ear and progressive low-frequency hearing loss. Ménière's disease is caused by a change in the volume of fluid inside the inner ear."

    "Vitamin B12 Deficiency":[
        "Vitamin B12 is needed to produce an adequate amount of healthy red blood cells in the bone marrow. Vitamin B12 is available only in animal foods (meat and dairy products) or yeast extracts (such as brewer's yeast). Vitamin B12 deficiency is defined by low levels of stored B12 in the body that can result in anemia, a lower-than-normal number of red blood cells."
    ],
    "Vitiligo":[
        "Vitiligo consists of white patches of skin that are caused by the loss of melanin, the pigment that is a major contributor to skin. Melanin is produced by special cells called melanocytes, which are destroyed in people who have vitiligo. The cause of vitiligo is not known but evidence strongly suggests that vitiligo is an autoimmune disorder, in which the body's immune system mistakenly targets and injures these specific cells. Vitiligo can cause minor changes or extensive changes in the skin. In some people, it may be hardly noticeable, while in others it is obvious. In dark-skinned people the vitiligo patches are obvious since they contrast with normal skin."
    ],
    "Vocal Cord Disorders":[
        "The vocal cords are two bands of elastic muscle tissue. They are located side by side in the voice box (larynx) just above the windpipe (trachea). Like other tissues in the body, vocal cords can be strained and damaged. Vocal cords are also subject to infections, tumors and trauma. When you are silent, the cords remain open. They create an airway through which you breathe. When you speak, the air you exhale from your lungs is forced through the closed vocal cords. This causes them to vibrate. They vibrate faster for higher-pitched sounds, slower for lower-pitched sounds. Strained vocal cords generally aren't noticed until the problem becomes severe. People who use their voices for a living or who shout or scream frequently are at particular risk. People who work in noisy environments that require shouting to communicate are also at risk."

    "Vulvar Cancer":[
        "Vulvar cancer occurs in the vulva, the external genital area of a woman's reproductive system. It can affect any part of the vulva, including the labia, the mons pubis (the skin and tissue that cover the pubic bone), the clitoris, or the vaginal or urethral openings. In most cases, it affects the inner edges of the labia majora or labia minora. The vast majority of vulvar cancers are squamous cell carcinomas. This cancer starts in squamous cells, the main type of skin cells. Squamous cell cancer usually develops over many years. Before it forms, abnormal cells usually develop in the surface layer of the skin, called the epithelium. This condition is called vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN)."

    "Waldenström Macroglobulinemia":[
        "Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) is a rare, slow-growing cancer. It is a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. WM is also known as lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. WM begins in the immune system. It starts in white blood cells called B lymphocytes (B cells). B cells play a key role in the body's immune system. Some B cells develop into plasma cells. Plasma cells make antibodies (also called immunoglobulins). Antibodies help the body attack bacteria, viruses, and other foreign substances. Sometimes B cells become cancerous before turning into mature plasma cells. These abnormal B cells multiply out of control. They produce large amounts of IgM antibody (immunoglobulin M). High levels of IgM can cause a person's blood to thicken. People with WM who have no symptoms of the disease are usually followed until symptoms or complications develop. This allows them to avoid the side effects of chemotherapy until they need treatment. Treatment begins if they have: hyperviscosity syndrome, anemia (low levels of red blood cells), kidney problems, heart problems, nerve damage. There is no standard treatment for a patient with WM. Treatment usually involves chemotherapy, biological therapy, or a combination of the two."

    "Warts":[
        "Warts are small skin growths caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV), which infects the top layer of skin. There are more than 40 different types of HPV. The wart virus can be transmitted from one person to another either by direct contact, or indirectly when both people come in contact with a surface, such as a floor or desk. People may come into contact with HPV by walking barefoot in public places, such as gyms and shower floors or by sexual contact. HPV also can be transmitted in the same person from one spot on the body to another. It is easier for HPV to infect a person when the person's skin is scratched or cut. The two types of warts seen most often are common warts and plantar warts. Common warts have a rough surface and well-defined borders. They are round or irregular in shape and usually range from 2 millimeters to 10 millimeters wide (the size of a pencil eraser or smaller). Common warts are firm and can be light gray, flesh-colored, yellow, brown or gray-black, Plantar warts appear on the bottom (sole) of the foot. They are flattened by the pressure of standing on them and can be dotted with tiny, clotted blood vessels that look like dark pinpoints. Plantar warts often are painful, especially when they're on a weight-bearing part of the foot. Most warts disappear within a year or two, even if they are not treated; however, without treatment warts may spread. Many people choose to have warts treated either because of minor pain or for cosmetic reasons. Treatment depends on the location of the wart, its type and size, a person's age and health, and his or her willingness to follow through with repeated treatments.  Genital warts should be treated and monitored in order to detect or prevent related cancers."

    "Wax blockage of the ear canal":[
        "In the outer part of the ear canal, cells produce a wax called cerumen that traps particles of dust and dirt. The wax also repels water, protecting the delicate eardrum from damage. The wax is moved outward gradually by the lining of the ear canal, carrying any dirt it has trapped. Eventually, the wax dries and falls out of the ear in small, unnoticeable flakes. Normal production of earwax is healthy and good for your ears. If too much wax is being produced, it can block the ear, but more commonly, the ear becomes blocked because of improper ear care and ear cleaning. If you push cotton swabs, pencils, your finger or other objects into your ear canal to try to remove wax, the force can push the wax further into the ear and compress it against the eardrum."

    "Wilms' Tumor":[
        "Wilms' tumor, also called nephroblastoma, is the most common form of kidney cancer in children. It develops when cancerous (malignant) kidney cells multiply out of control, eventually forming a mass. This mass usually is smooth and fairly round. As it grows, Wilms' tumor changes the normal shape and appearance of the kidney. It also can destroy normal kidney tissue and cause bleeding into the urine. In some cases, the tumor eventually becomes noticeable as a firm, smooth lump in the child's side or abdomen. Without proper treatment, the cancer can spread to other organs—usually the lungs and liver."

    "Wrist Sprain":[
        "A sprain in the wrist is an injury to its ligaments, the tough bands of fibrous tissue that connect bones to one another inside a joint. Although most people speak of the wrist as a single joint between the forearm and hand, the wrist actually contains many joints that link 15 separate bones. The ligaments that connect these bones can be torn by any extreme twist, bend or impact that suddenly forces the wrist into a position beyond its normal range of motion. There are three levels of sprain: Mild (Grade I) — The wrist's ligaments are stretched or have microscopic tears, Moderate (Grade II) — The damage is more severe, and some wrist ligaments may be partially torn, Severe sprains (Grade III) — One or more wrist ligaments are entirely torn or torn away from where they normally attach to bones."

It's a tropical illness that was once common in West Africa, Indonesia, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Haiti, Dominica, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador and parts of Brazil. In these countries, yaws most often affects children between the ages of 2 and 5, especially children who wear few clothes, have frequent skin injuries and live in areas of poor hygiene. During the 1950s, yaws was a common tropical illness, infecting 50 million to 100 million people. Since that time, the World Health Organization (WHO) has battled yaws in many tropical areas of the world."

        "Mental illness, also called mental health disorders, refers to a wide range of mental health conditions — disorders that affect your mood, thinking and behavior. Examples of mental illness include depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders and addictive behaviors. Signs and symptoms of mental illness can vary, depending on the disorder, circumstances and other factors. Mental illness symptoms can affect emotions, thoughts and behaviors. Examples of signs and symptoms include: Feeling sad or down, Confused thinking or reduced ability to concentrate, Excessive fears or worries, or extreme feelings of guilt, Extreme mood changes of highs and lows, withdrawal from friends and activities, Significant tiredness, low energy or problems sleeping, Detachment from reality (delusions), paranoia or hallucinations, Inability to cope with daily problems or stress, Trouble understanding and relating to situations and to people, Problems with alcohol or drug use, Major changes in eating habits, Sex drive changes, Excessive anger, hostility or violence, Suicidal thinking. If you have any signs or symptoms of a mental illness, see your primary care provider or a mental health professional. Most mental illnesses don't improve on their own, and if untreated, a mental illness may get worse over time and cause serious problems. Suicidal thoughts and behavior are common with some mental illnesses. If you think you may hurt yourself or attempt suicide, get help right away: Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately, Call your mental health specialist, Call a suicide hotline number. In the U.S., call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255) or use its webchat on suicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat, Seek help from your primary care provider, Reach out to a close friend or loved one, Contact a minister, spiritual leader or someone else in your faith community. There's no sure way to prevent mental illness. However, if you have a mental illness, taking steps to control stress, to increase your resilience and to boost low self-esteem may help keep your symptoms under control. Follow these steps: Pay attention to warning signs. Work with your doctor or therapist to learn what might trigger your symptoms, Get routine medical care. Don't neglect checkups or skip visits to your primary care provider, especially if you aren't feeling well, Get help when you need it. Mental health conditions can be harder to treat if you wait until symptoms get bad. Long-term maintenance treatment also may help prevent a relapse of symptoms, Take good care of yourself. Sufficient sleep, healthy eating and regular physical activity are important. Try to maintain a regular schedule. Talk to your primary care provider if you have trouble sleeping or if you have questions about diet and physical activity."

After having chickenpox as a child or shingles as an adult, the virus can lay dormant in the body. Why the virus reactivates and produces symptoms of Ramsay Hunt is not known. Strong anti-inflammatory drugs called steroids (such as prednisone) are usually given. Antiviral medicines, such as acyclovir or valacyclovir may be given. Sometimes strong painkillers are also needed if the pain continues even with steroids. Some people may use a special eye lubricant at night and artificial tears during the day to prevent the eye from drying out."

    "Monkeypox":[
        "Monkeypox is a disease caused by the monkeypox virus. It is a viral zoonotic disease, meaning that it can spread from animals to humans. It can also spread between people. Symptoms of monkeypox typically include a fever, intense headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy, swollen lymph nodes and a skin rash or lesions. The rash usually begins within one to three days of the start of a fever. You can reduce your risk by limiting contact with people who have suspected or confirmed monkeypox. If you do need to have physical contact with someone who has monkeypox because you are a health worker or live together, encourage the infected person to self-isolate and cover any skin lesion if they can (e.g., by wearing clothing over the rash). When you are physically close to them, they should wear a medical mask, especially if they are coughing or have lesions in their mouth. You should wear one also. Avoid skin-to-skin contact whenever possible and use disposable gloves if you have any direct contact with lesions. Wear a mask when handling any clothes or bedding if the person cannot do it themselves. Regularly clean your hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub, especially after contact with the person who is infected, their clothes, bed sheets, towels and other items or surfaces they have touched or that might have come into contact with their rash or respiratory secretions (e.g., utensils, dishes). Monkeypox symptoms often resolve on their own without the need for treatment. It is important to take care of the rash by letting it dry if possible or covering with a moist dressing to protect the area if needed. Avoid touching any sores in the mouth or eyes. Mouth rinses and eye drops can be used as long as cortisone-containing products are avoided. Vaccinia immune globulin (VIG) may be recommended for severe cases. An antiviral that was developed to treat smallpox (tecovirimat, commercialized as TPOXX) was also approved for the treatment of monkeypox in January 2022."

    "Sensory Processing Disorder":[
        "Sensory processing disorder (SPD) is a condition that affects how your brain processes sensory information (stimuli). Sensory information includes things you see, hear, smell, taste, or touch. SPD can affect all of your senses, or just one. SPD usually means you’re overly sensitive to stimuli that other people are not. But the disorder can cause the opposite effect, too. In these cases, it takes more stimuli to impact you. Children may be oversensitive if they: Think clothing feels too scratchy or itchy, Think lights seem too bright, Think sounds seem too loud, Think soft touches feel too hard,Experience food textures make them gag, Have poor balance or seem clumsy, Are afraid to play on the swings, React poorly to sudden movements, touches, loud noises, or bright lights, Have behavior problems, Sometimes these symptoms are linked to poor motor skills as well. Doctors don’t know what causes SPD. Treatment is usually done through therapy. Research shows that starting therapy early is key for treating SPD: Sensory integration therapy (SI). This type of therapy uses fun activities in a controlled environment, Sensory diet. Many times, a sensory diet will supplement other SPD therapies. A sensory diet isn’t your typical food diet, Occupational therapy. Your child also may need this therapy to help with other symptoms related to SPD. It can help with fine motor skills, such as handwriting and using scissors. Talk to your doctor about how a therapist fits in your health insurance."
